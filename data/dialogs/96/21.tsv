2009-08-27T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	if you are deleting the folder we copied to your home folder you will need to run: gksudo nautilus   then delete it, then close nautilus
2009-08-27T15:51:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 where can i see transmission in which folder?
2009-08-27T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	the binary is in /usr/bin the rest of the app is scattered throughout the system
2009-08-27T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	the default save location is the desktop, you can change this so your system is neater
2009-08-27T15:53:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 if i open a torrent file it opens with deluge, how could i do with transmission?
2009-08-27T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	download a .torrent file to the desktop . right click it -> open with ->other program and select transmission and select remember this setting
2009-08-27T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	you can also change aps in firefox so that it is the default app to use
2009-08-27T15:55:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 :) ok

2009-09-01T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	you will need to instal compizconfig-settings-manager and emerald
2009-09-01T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	you will also need to have full 3d drivers installed and running
2009-09-01T14:57:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 thanx, dude
2012-01-05T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	does the OS eventually load OK
2012-01-05T08:30:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 yes
2012-01-05T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	do you use nvidia or ati gpu with proprietary driver?
2012-01-05T08:31:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 yes nvidia
2012-01-05T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	the nvidia driver doesn't load in time to give a boot splash, that's why you get the issue. Its nothing bad as the OS does load
2012-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 so keep it with showing everytime when booting the syc message?
2012-01-05T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	yes, there is a hack or two you can do if you are really bothered
2012-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 give me your opinion
2012-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	of what?
2012-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 what can i do to show me the ubuntu screen image loading?
2012-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	personally I wouldn't bother as the OS boots, its just a looks thing and the OS boots quick so its not really worth faffing around
2012-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	if you really want: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/
2012-01-05T08:40:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 thanx but whats that?
2012-01-05T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	it makes the system use the fb driver which loads fast and will show the splash, when the X server loads the nvidia driver will load
2012-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 ah ok thanx
2012-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolf23	its a bit of messing around but if a pretty boot splash is THAT important to you then go ahead and fill your boots. Personaly I'd not bother
2012-01-05T08:49:00.000Z	wolf23	ActionParsnip	 thank you friend so i keep it if not necessary
