2004-09-27T14:18:00.000Z	calc		hmm can you request specific types of cd's on the site?
2004-09-27T14:20:00.000Z	calc		bbs
2004-09-27T14:20:00.000Z	calc		well web forum/bbs thing
2004-09-27T14:22:00.000Z	calc		phpBB is just as nice and free
2004-09-27T14:23:00.000Z	jdub	calc	ideally we'd like something that interfaced to our mailing lists
2004-09-27T14:23:00.000Z	jdub	calc	so if you know anything that does nntp backend...
2004-10-31T14:33:00.000Z	calc	jdub	shaddup n00b1e
2004-11-01T12:44:00.000Z	calc	jdub	so how many downloads has ubuntu gotten so far?
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	jdub	calc	uninstalling menu makes it have no menu items ;)
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	jdub	calc	but the menu itself stays there
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	calc	jdub	oh hahaha it doesn't make the top level go away
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	calc	jdub	so how will it show debian menu items now?
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	jdub	calc	[menu.c is gnome-panel is famously horrific :-) ] 
2004-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	jdub	calc	it doesn't.
2004-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	calc	jdub	isn't that a violation of policy for debian's anyway
2004-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	jdub	calc	from my POV, the debian menu structure is terrible, and the kinds of stuff that appears in it is baroque. :-)
2004-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	calc	jdub	agreed
2004-11-16T12:43:00.000Z	calc	jdub	something needs to be done to unify the menu in fdo, once more than just kde supports menu spec it will be a big mess
2004-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	jdub	calc	yeah
2004-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	jdub	calc	especially with menu-xdg... eeeeeek! :)
2004-11-16T12:46:00.000Z	calc	jdub	eh?
2004-11-16T12:48:00.000Z	jdub	calc	given the haphazard nature of the menu structure already, adding menu-xdg items to the gnome/kde structure is going to be seriously scary. (not menu-xdg's fault, it's the items themselves.)
2004-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	calc	jdub	wrt menu-xdg all of them are shoved off into a debian submenu like gnome was
2004-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	jdub	calc	so i don't think we'll be shipping menu-xdg (unless we patch all the menu items). ;-)
2004-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	jdub	calc	oh right.
2004-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	calc	jdub	it builds out a debian menu that looks the same as any other wm that just uses the debian default layout
2004-11-16T12:53:00.000Z	calc	jdub	it looks like: http://cheney.cx/menu-xdg.jpg
2004-11-16T12:54:00.000Z	jdub	calc	404...
2004-11-16T12:55:00.000Z	calc	jdub	should be there now
2004-11-16T12:56:00.000Z	jdub	calc	ahr. yeah.
2004-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	calc	jdub	better hide out in the other channel, too many people here ;)
2004-12-03T08:19:00.000Z	jdub	calc	gnome 2.8 in warty, 2.9 in hoary ;-)
2004-12-03T08:19:00.000Z	calc	jdub	whee 8)
2004-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	calc	jdub	#ubuntu means blackhole of all off topic freenode discussions :)
2004-12-03T11:50:00.000Z	calc	jdub	hopefully #ubuntu won't become as bad as #debian ;)
2004-12-03T15:15:00.000Z	jdub	calc	the gelato project are collaborating :)
2004-12-03T15:23:00.000Z	jdub	calc	evo's a bit b0rk atm.
2004-12-03T15:24:00.000Z	calc	jdub	well the whole OS shouldn't go down is what i meant to say, gnome related stuff is the only things in early beta on hoary, right?
2004-12-03T15:25:00.000Z	jdub	calc	yeah
2004-12-03T15:25:00.000Z	jdub	calc	so i hear you're moving into gnome development :)
2004-12-05T16:22:00.000Z	calc	jdub	good job :)
2004-12-05T16:25:00.000Z	jdub	calc	install credits to Kamion :)
2005-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	jdub	calc	but debian and ubuntu are STRONGER THAN THEM ALL! riowr! :-) :-)
2005-01-26T14:41:00.000Z	calc	jdub	yes
2005-01-26T14:48:00.000Z	jdub	calc	what you learn with lfs/gentoo is kinda facile though
2005-01-26T14:49:00.000Z	calc	jdub	true, lfs didn't exist when i started using linux so i just learned from a book and slackware 2
2005-01-26T14:51:00.000Z	jdub	calc	it's a bit like "made sushi before? no? here's a blindfold and some seaweed!"
2005-01-26T14:51:00.000Z	calc	jdub	rotflmao, yea i guess that is a good point, perhaps it should include some more chapters explaining better what you are actually doing
2005-01-26T14:55:00.000Z	calc	jdub	well with how seldom debian releases, probably under 50K
2005-01-26T15:12:00.000Z	calc	jdub	putting it at the end makes it faster, or for some other reason?
2005-01-26T15:12:00.000Z	jdub	calc	disk heads switch there faster
2005-01-26T15:13:00.000Z	jdub	calc	only really matters on machines where swap performance matters (not a desktop issue, generally)
2005-01-26T15:13:00.000Z	calc	jdub	ok
2005-01-26T15:21:00.000Z	calc	jdub	there is a mini.iso that does net install ;)
2005-01-26T15:21:00.000Z	calc	jdub	is that not supposed to be publicized?
2005-01-26T15:22:00.000Z	jdub	calc	i always forget about that.
2005-01-26T15:23:00.000Z	jdub	calc	now you do get lynched for that :)
2005-01-26T15:27:00.000Z	jdub	calc	vicious man.
2005-01-26T15:27:00.000Z	calc	jdub	heh :)
2005-01-26T15:28:00.000Z	calc	jdub	btw does gnome have that same sort of problem?
2005-01-26T15:29:00.000Z	jdub	calc	yeah
2005-01-26T15:31:00.000Z	calc	jdub	btw seen fc3, it seems redhat got the idea to use the (near) default look of gnome from ubuntu ;)
2005-01-26T15:31:00.000Z	jdub	calc	heh
2005-01-26T15:32:00.000Z	jdub	calc	oh, bluecurve is just the theme
2005-01-26T15:32:00.000Z	jdub	calc	bottom bar was just red hat default configuration
2005-01-26T15:33:00.000Z	calc	jdub	oh they had it so that you could switch to kicker and have it look identical?
2005-01-26T15:33:00.000Z	jdub	calc	that was some kind of handwavy goal, yeah
2005-01-26T15:33:00.000Z	jdub	calc	but i think in fedora they realised all the users though that was LCD
2005-01-26T15:35:00.000Z	calc	jdub	btw is there any way to format a cd/dvd in ubuntu now besides using the command line with dvd+rw-tools?
2005-01-26T15:37:00.000Z	jdub	calc	i think n-c-b automatically formats before writing
2005-01-26T15:37:00.000Z	jdub	calc	but i'm not sure if you can explicitly do it
2005-01-27T09:07:00.000Z	jdub	calc	possibly, there were some katie problems earlier
2005-01-27T09:08:00.000Z	calc	jdub	the md5sum doesn't match
2005-02-10T13:44:00.000Z	jdub	calc	note "sane" :)
2005-02-10T13:45:00.000Z	calc	jdub	well fdo menu spec etc shouldn't get in the way much i've seen the actual output of editted menu items, etc and it looks sane to me
2005-02-10T13:46:00.000Z	jdub	calc	notice how you're not talking about user interaction? :)
2005-02-10T13:48:00.000Z	jdub	calc	see, direct manipulation is more attractive, but also more unwieldy with menus and submenus; the standalone editor route is completely abstract.
2005-02-10T13:49:00.000Z	jdub	calc	currently, i'm aiming to get rid of the applications menu idea entirely.
2005-02-10T13:49:00.000Z	jdub	calc	launchers
2005-02-10T13:50:00.000Z	jdub	calc	the ui would have to change more drastically to accomodate it
2005-02-10T13:50:00.000Z	calc	jdub	ok] 
2005-02-10T13:50:00.000Z	jdub	calc	consider the difference between the OS9 and OSX execution models
2005-02-10T13:51:00.000Z	calc	jdub	not very familiar with those, sorry
2005-02-10T13:52:00.000Z	jdub	calc	used windowmaker?
2005-02-10T13:52:00.000Z	calc	jdub	yes
2005-02-10T13:52:00.000Z	jdub	calc	so windowmaker conflates the idea of what's running and what's there to run
2005-02-10T13:52:00.000Z	jdub	calc	this is quite similar to osx (osx and windowmaker being based on next, etc)
2005-02-10T13:53:00.000Z	calc	jdub	ah with the osx bottom bar?
2005-02-10T13:54:00.000Z	jdub	calc	most people only regularly directly execute 3-6 things
2005-02-10T13:54:00.000Z	calc	jdub	yea
2005-02-10T13:55:00.000Z	jdub	calc	so why do we have great big long menus of categories of stuff they'd rarely run directly (think gpdf, it's *very* rare that you'd run gpdf itself - you'd open a pdf)
2005-02-10T13:55:00.000Z	jdub	calc	so there's the vague handwaving behind it :)
2005-02-10T13:56:00.000Z	jdub	calc	it's all smoke and mirrors on osx too you know :)
2005-02-10T13:57:00.000Z	jdub	calc	just means we have to think in the user's terms instead of the mechanics underneath ;)
2005-02-10T13:57:00.000Z	calc	jdub	ok, have only seen osx at in store demos :\  i need to get one now that i have a job finally
2005-02-10T13:57:00.000Z	jdub	calc	that menu is not in osx, btw
