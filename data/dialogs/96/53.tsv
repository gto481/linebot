2006-10-27T13:37:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 you'll probably find a proceedure to do it in the forum
2006-10-27T13:39:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 ubuntu is suppose to recognise most if not all of your hardware
2006-10-27T13:39:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 which doesn't mean you might not have a little configurating to do
2006-10-27T13:40:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 best place to check is the forum
2006-10-27T13:40:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 as far as emulating wiindows for certain apps,  use  wine, it works quite well  ,   www,.winehq.org/download/
2006-10-27T13:42:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 technicaly wine isn'T an emulator but it's not realy resource hungry,  but it is in develeopment and some apps have little annoyance in them
2006-10-27T13:43:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	,  have you tried partition magic ?  I think you can recover butnot sure
2006-10-27T13:46:00.000Z	kodat	Pelo	is there like..any interface that sorta has similar mac type..like the bubble buttons stuff like that

2006-10-27T13:49:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	I am realy not the one to help you with wireless stuff,  my setup is pretty simple ,  computer > modem
2006-10-27T13:49:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 eth0 would be your ethernet card ( ie your network card)
2006-10-27T13:50:00.000Z	kodat	Pelo	ahh..i didnt know eth was the card
2006-10-27T13:50:00.000Z	kodat	Pelo	i wonder what my wireless card name is..maybe its the lo
2006-10-27T13:51:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 I have one of those lo card to but I don't have a wireless one so that's probably not it ,  have you checked the forum for instructions ?

2006-10-27T13:59:00.000Z	kodat	Pelo	haha nice all my hardware is unknown..looks like i got lots of driver installations to go
2006-10-27T14:00:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 you donT' need to install all your drivers,  the fact that they are unknown just means that ubu is just working off some more generic drivers, which are usualy fine
2006-10-27T14:01:00.000Z	kodat	Pelo	so in which cases would i need to install the drivers
2006-10-27T14:02:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 application > accessories  > terminal
2006-10-27T14:02:00.000Z	kodat	Pelo	thans

2006-10-28T07:24:00.000Z	Pelo	kodat	 the screen resolution stuff is easy enough it's just a xorg.conf  editing ( but I can't help you there because I realy donT' know the specs for your screen) and I can'T help you with teh wireless stuff,  best of luck
