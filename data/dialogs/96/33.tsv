2008-06-22T08:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	no, we can.t
2008-06-22T08:01:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	was just wondering bcuz ive asked about the io-apic and didnt get any reply
2008-06-22T08:02:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	if nobody knows about your problem they just don't respond...usually keep askign every few minutes (roughly 3-5) and you'll eventually get help from somebody who does know
2008-06-22T08:07:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	but that's not multi-screen, that's workspaces
2008-06-22T08:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	multi-screen is usually synonymous with dual monitor/dual head
2008-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	where did you hear that?
2008-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	in here a while back
2008-06-22T08:22:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	some random nobody said it i bet
2008-06-22T08:43:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	now in gparted swapoff is only per session?
2008-06-22T08:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	no clue, i never used gparted
2008-06-22T08:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	agreed. supreme commander is the sole purpose of windows on my machine
2008-06-22T08:45:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I think he's in a TTY, not sure if that shortcut works there
2008-06-22T08:47:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 voice?
2008-06-22T08:47:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I know that, I was wondering his reasons though because if not for voice/video I always recommend pidgin over trying to get their clients to work :P
2008-06-22T09:10:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	stumble upon extension for firefox
2008-06-22T10:10:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	so did i, but i've seen nothing but problems for many people
2008-06-22T10:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	where can I get some screenlets from? I want to use my awesome compiz widget layer, but nothing to use with it
2008-06-22T10:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	googling gives no good results
2008-06-22T10:26:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	screenlets.org
2008-06-22T10:27:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	down :(
2008-06-22T10:50:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I have XP running in a VM, plus all my other apps on my desktop, and i've never come close to using 2gb
2008-06-22T23:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	those are right angle and left angle quotes
2008-06-22T23:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	no clue about the second question
2008-06-22T23:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	in html it's &raquo;
2008-06-22T23:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	that line was empty
2008-06-22T23:16:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	nope, i t hink irc doesn't transmit those special characters
2008-06-22T23:16:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	that little box is for characters not in your character set though
2008-06-22T23:18:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	so any idea on how i can find out what character set that belongs to??  or is it just "you dont have it, so here's a box"
2008-06-22T23:18:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	and its kinda funny that the kernel would display a charset i dont have... thats from dmesg btw
2008-06-22T23:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	not that you don't necesarily don't have, just that you aren't using
2008-06-22T23:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	no idea what that's about then :P
2008-06-22T23:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I know I get those with those retarded slant quotes from MS word
2008-06-22T23:19:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	so on a fresh install, i would have to enable special charsets to view dmesg the right way?
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	you choosing the right workgroup?
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I left it as the default workgroup
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	should it be anything particular?
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	i mean when you go to get the folder
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	you should see workgroup and vboxsvr
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I tried the \\vboxsvr and it couldn't find it
2008-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 or something like that
2008-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	nothing
2008-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	try network places
2008-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	yeah, that's where I'm at. it's an empty pane
2008-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 then try map network drive
2008-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I can't go to \\vboxsvr though, that's the problem
2008-08-12T08:33:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 then try map network drive
2008-08-12T08:33:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 where share is the name of the share
2008-08-12T08:34:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	System error 67, network name cannot be found
2008-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	thats the problem i had with xp
2008-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 network didnt work
2008-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	any idea how to fix it?
2008-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 scrap xp and use 2000?
2008-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	no can do :(
2008-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 try using a different card setup in vb settings
2008-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 and your using xVM and not ose?
2008-08-12T08:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	yeah
2008-08-12T08:41:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	  your going to have to set up a non nat network connection in xp which in virtual box is impossible unless its been fixed since i had the prob, to be able to ping your host
2008-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	so is there just no way to do it? why can I do it with seemingly random installs of vbox and xp but seemingly random others can't
2008-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 the share thing *should* work oob
2008-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	jmichelsen that's what way I'm doing it is through vbox
2008-08-12T08:43:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 lemmie see what google tells me
2008-08-12T08:43:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	I've been looking and haven't found much yet :(

2008-08-12T08:46:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 no guarentees on getting support there though
2008-08-12T08:46:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 they are usually slow to the punch
2008-08-12T08:46:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	:(
2008-08-12T08:48:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 have you read this?  http://www.ubuntugeek.com/create-and-manage-virtual-machines-using-virtualbox.html

2008-08-12T09:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	only 2 things could make seamless better: integrating it with gnome, so each window acts as their own window, and making it so when you drag a window you don't see flickers of windows desktop
2008-08-12T09:01:00.000Z	unavailable	dmsuperman	 try this, minimize all windows in windows
2008-08-12T09:01:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	why not? nothing's happened
2008-08-12T09:01:00.000Z	dmsuperman	unavailable	ah!
