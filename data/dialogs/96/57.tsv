2007-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	bruenig		can't you just do init 3
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	whats the difference between rmmod and modprobe -r?
2007-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	not sure perhaps none
2007-07-06T12:07:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	you would be able to have an equal amount, but for the cube, you need four yes
2007-07-10T08:46:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	dude, i've been using this for a year, compiled a bunch before, read a few howtos on rolling debs, and i did not understand what you just said
2007-07-10T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	you know how to build a deb?
2007-07-10T08:47:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	nope! those howtos were wayyyy confusing :p
2007-07-10T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	do you know how to build any other package formats?
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	nope
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	closest i get is checkinstall
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	oh, well basically you take an empty directory, you put all the files in the empty directory as if the empty directory is root, so if you have a file that you want installed to /usr/bin/foo, you put it in emptydirectory/usr/bin/foo
2007-07-10T11:27:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	we've got it mounted at /media/drive
2007-07-10T11:27:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	the current permissions are 755
2007-07-10T11:27:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	root owns it
2007-07-10T11:27:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	"sudo chmod -R +w /media/drive" doesnt help and still says read only
2007-07-10T11:30:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	how did you mount it though
2007-07-10T11:30:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	"sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/drive"
2007-07-10T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/drive
2007-07-10T11:31:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	ah ok
2007-07-10T11:32:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	she said shealready followed that, so i assume ntfs-3g is installed
2007-07-10T11:32:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	right I would think so also, but then again if she followed it, it should be working so...
2007-07-10T11:39:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	gconf must die.  or at least get a sensible gui
2007-07-10T12:06:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i got mixed up
2007-07-10T12:10:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	lies
2007-07-10T12:10:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	--purge cleans up the config files
2007-07-10T12:11:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	isnt that why aptitude is recommended on the forums all the time?
2007-07-10T12:11:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	because it removes the dependencies on uninstall while apt-get doesnt remove them on uninstall
2007-07-10T12:11:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	that is incorrect
2007-07-10T12:11:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	see apt-get autoremove
2007-07-10T12:12:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i know about autoremove
2007-07-10T12:12:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	ok so then what are you talking about
2007-07-10T12:12:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	on the forums ive seen it said basically that aptitude makes it so you dont need autoremove
2007-07-10T12:12:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	that it pulls in the not-required-but-good-to-have dependencies, and then does the autoremove stuff automagically
2007-07-10T12:13:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	that statement makes no sense, I read on the forums that apt-get autoremove makes it so you don't need aptitude remove
2007-07-10T12:13:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	the last word was autoremove not aptitude remove
2007-07-10T12:13:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	what?
2007-07-10T12:13:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	no but you just said, using one program to do X means that you don't have to use another program to do X
2007-07-10T12:14:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	on the forums, i read that aptitude install and aptitude uninstall, when used on the same package, make it so that when you remove the packge it automatically does the remove and the autoremove instead of you having to do them as two steps
2007-07-10T12:14:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	apt-get autoremove package
2007-07-10T12:14:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	one step
2007-07-10T12:15:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	didnt know that could go there..ok....so why is aptitude recommended?
2007-07-10T12:15:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	because people like you keep echoing it and then the people in here read what you said and they say it and so forth and so on
2007-07-10T12:16:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	ok so how about what purpose does aptitude on the command line serve? i know it can be a gui, but why the command part of it?
2007-07-10T12:16:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	the only thing that is nice about aptitude is the log from what I can see
2007-07-10T12:29:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	yes
2007-07-10T12:29:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	how
2007-07-10T12:29:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i dont know, but i did before i learned how to set a root password, so i know it's possible
2007-07-10T12:30:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	must have been patched or something because from the man pages and config files it looks like you would need two separate users
2007-07-10T12:30:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i installed it last august and only got a root password in december when my ex was too lazy to sudo su -
2007-07-10T12:48:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	is there a way to make the nerdy startup text green when you disable splash?
2007-07-10T12:49:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	I could do that in my current distro, not sure how to do it in ubuntu
2007-07-10T12:49:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	whats your current?
2007-07-10T12:50:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	It was white and I needed to make it gray so that I could see it when I did the stuff from the white terminal when I was logged in
2007-07-10T12:50:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	white terminal?
2007-07-10T12:50:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	white back ground and black text
2007-07-10T12:51:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	whyd it get like that?
2007-07-10T12:51:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	the text was white and so you couldn't see it
2007-07-10T12:51:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	I set it white because in vim syntax highlight, comments are this really dark blue and I would always not be able to see it
2007-07-10T12:52:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	you can :set background=dark
2007-07-10T12:52:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	and then the syntax highlighting will be colored for on dark monitors
2007-07-10T12:52:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	the blue is technically able to be seen, like right now on white, I have the same problem with light yellow
2007-07-10T12:53:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	if you set it to say background=dark it uses all light-colored syntax highlighting
2007-07-10T12:53:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	ok I will try that
2007-07-10T12:53:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	you can change the syntax colors in your .vimrc too
2007-07-10T12:54:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i fiddle with my vimrc a bunch :p i just wanna find a way to make it highlight the variable names though...make it easier to track them when coding
2007-07-11T09:31:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/your-debian-aptitude
2007-07-11T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	ok so he basically likes the names better, that is it
2007-07-11T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	his dependency claim is flat out wrong
2007-07-11T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	presumably this is the reason: 19 August 2005 - 9:16pm  Larry
2007-07-11T09:34:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	yeah i thought the names thing was lame too, what's the date to do with it?
2007-07-11T09:35:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	names, the search results are justified and in alpha order, those are his advantages
2007-07-11T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	those are cosmetic at best, they certainly don't justify the kind of aptitude schilling we see in here
2007-07-11T09:38:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	well since i just saw the aptitude thing being said on the forums i replied asking if the person had a reliable (with the phrase "no blogs, official documentation only") source for that assertion since i'm being told it's wrong
2007-07-11T09:39:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	2 years ago or so, aptitude has dependency removal, apt-get did not, that drives people to say it is better even thought it is no longer the case
2007-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i see
2007-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	so at one point it was true, but not anymore?
2007-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	that's why all the threads and such you see will be dated 2005 generally
2007-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	right
2007-07-21T05:09:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	wifi-radar saves the passphrases for all the wireless networks without a keyring?
2007-07-21T05:10:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	yes it saves them in a text file
2007-07-21T05:10:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	you need to be root to use it, so it is a good idea to edit /etc/sudoers to make sure you can bypass having to provide a password for it everytime, but other than that very smooth
2007-08-09T07:37:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	the bot's out to lunch
2007-08-09T08:13:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	beat
2007-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	ive used it for a year and tried other distros, but i like apt more than other package managers, so i stick with ubuntu.  for a minimal install on an old box, i used debian though
2007-08-09T08:18:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	the discrete releases are just too much
2007-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	pacman though is the best
2007-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	what distro uses that?
2007-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	i hear the rpath (i think?) one is nice
2007-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	arch
2007-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	ill try it some time
2007-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	frugalware also uses it, but frugalware is really poor
2007-11-25T04:36:00.000Z	macogw	bruenig	launchpad lacks bug voting
2007-11-25T04:36:00.000Z	bruenig	macogw	oh well can at least leave a comment or something
