2009-04-21T03:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nasra	I didn't have much luck when I tried to install a .bin last time  which was ages ago.  it's only stupid propritary software for Linux that uses .bin, and I  only want propritary software that has a proper purpouse in  my Ubuntu really, such as Adobe Flash for example
2009-04-21T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nasra	why do the propritary software venders have to be differnet, why can't they provide debs or rpms or .tar.gz's like everyone else?
2009-04-21T03:56:00.000Z	Nasra	sebsebseb	you see I managed to installed in test pc but it does not want to start ...I put it in the /home/maximo/desktop....does not want to kicking perhasp you could get me started
2009-04-21T03:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Nasra	not for .bin's I still slightly wonder how to  install myself lol    you can ask in #linux   and tell me how to do it :d  as well.
2009-04-21T03:57:00.000Z	Nasra	sebsebseb	okay
2010-09-14T07:41:00.000Z	Nasra	sebsebseb	how are you man?
