2011-07-30T14:39:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	yes
2011-07-30T14:40:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	It's the same install..
2011-07-30T14:40:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	cool when you get the cd up plugin the thumb and go to disk manager and unm,ount it.
2011-07-30T14:41:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	ok..
2011-07-30T14:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	once you have done that run this command and identify the usb installed partition with this command sudo fdisk -l
2011-07-30T14:42:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	ok I'm still starting up...
2011-07-30T14:43:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	soory it the disk utility for unmounting  opps
2011-07-30T14:46:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	: ok I've ran sudo fdisk -l and the device is is sdb
2011-07-30T14:47:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	what is the partition like sda1
2011-07-30T14:47:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	it's an ntfs windows...
2011-07-30T14:47:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	you ave a installed windows on the usb not linux
2011-07-30T14:48:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	the usb is sdb
2011-07-30T14:49:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	hold on lets get this straight what is installed on the usb
2011-07-30T14:50:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	on the usb I've have a linux installation of ubuntu 10.10 called sdb. On the laptops hard disk called sda it is windows
2011-07-30T14:52:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	: It is a hard disk installation but on a usb-stick
2011-07-30T14:52:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	okay that is fine I thought you meant that the usb was a ntfs partition.  sdb is the thumbs over all identification look at the fdisk-l and tell me the sdb# that is the actual partition installed to we need this to get it fixed.
2011-07-30T14:53:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	yes sdb is the one...
2011-07-30T14:53:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	I need a actual partition look closer sdb is the device I need a sdb with a number at the end
2011-07-30T14:55:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	sdb contains sdb1, sdb2,sdb5 where 1 is an 83(ext4?) 2 is a 5 and sdb5 is 82(ext3?)
2011-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	so sdb5 is the partition where linux is installed, this is very important .
2011-07-30T14:57:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	sdb5 starts at 3729 ends at 3895 and uses 1333248 blocks
2011-07-30T14:58:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	here lets try this open gparted, in the top right corner is a dropdown click on the usb and take a screen shot and imagebin it, we are getting no where.
2011-07-30T14:58:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	: it's denoted as a Linux swap/solaris
2011-07-30T15:00:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	that is not helpful; follow my instuctions or I will stop helping.
2011-07-30T15:00:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	: I'm writning from my working computer but I'll try to send it some how from the live cd computer...
2011-07-30T15:01:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	we have to know exactly what partition Linux is in you can't tell me you we need to work with that.
2011-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	I've opened gparted and I'm looking at sdb: sdb1 has a bootflag and is ext4, sdb2 is an extended, sdb5 is a linux swap. Tell me what you need
2011-07-30T15:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	all I need is for you to tell which is which partition the install is in, can you figure ta=hat out.
2011-07-30T15:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	aGamingDaddy	linux does not need a boot flag, so that means nothing here, just the booting partition the ?
2011-07-30T15:08:00.000Z	aGamingDaddy	nit-wit	the patition volume (sdb1) is using 9.36 Gb, the otheres are not using any space
