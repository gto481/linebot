2005-09-23T11:39:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki		ok if i ll ask 3 good questions , am i then worthy of private discussion?
2005-09-23T11:39:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki		why has ubuntu better mono support than debian?
2005-09-23T11:39:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	it doesn't
2005-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	sure, just like Debian does
2005-09-23T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	same as on any other linux OS; it depends on what tool you use
2005-09-23T11:44:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	please stop trying to weasel out of the channe, it's really quite annoying
2005-09-23T11:44:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	how is asking question here "spam"?
2005-09-23T11:45:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	no, it's not
2005-09-23T11:45:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	if you have trouble following, then you need to read faster or filter out things you don't care about it
2005-09-23T11:48:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	plug it in
2005-09-23T11:49:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	a window  will pop up; drag stuff to it, select burn, all done
2005-09-23T11:50:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	, ok thx for answr which Burn Software with GUI u can recommend?
2005-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	the file manager is a perfectly good dvd burner
2005-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	: does it support UDF?
2005-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	yes
2005-09-23T11:53:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	there's obviously no "best"
2005-10-05T10:08:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	even if you install and use gnome, there's no "config tool to find new HW"
2005-10-05T10:08:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	hotplug will load modules for most everything automatically
2005-10-05T10:09:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	what gui does hotplug require? how do i use it?
2005-10-05T10:09:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	there's no gui
2005-10-05T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	it loads modules automatically
2005-10-05T10:10:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	no gui, ... i see the fun with linux starts & end with the prompt.. ;)
2005-10-05T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	there's nothing to do
2005-10-05T10:11:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	the module gets loaded, software can start using the hardware
2005-10-05T10:11:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	what would you want the gui to do?
2005-10-08T11:28:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	build-essential
2005-10-09T14:33:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	presumably you want mozilla-browser

2005-10-11T14:29:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	"plz" is not a word
2005-10-11T14:29:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	did you actually look in the swp file yet?
2005-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	yes...not really readble text...strange characters... :(

2005-10-11T14:36:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	I'm not sure what you expect me to do, I don't have a backup of your file
2005-10-11T14:36:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	may be i expect there to be a command to create txtfile from swapfile?
2005-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	doubt it
2005-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	does the "java" command do something?
2005-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	it seems all in the swp file but its VERY strange coded...any idea how to remove that swp coding?
2005-10-11T14:47:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	it seems as i some how get managed in recover mode
2005-10-11T14:48:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	bob2	but that mode said , 1 Block could not be read.. how do i avoid this block?
2005-10-11T14:48:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	I said above I have no idea
2005-10-12T14:45:00.000Z	bob2	Shin_Gouki	that's not your real question, tell us what you're trying to do
