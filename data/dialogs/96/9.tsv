2011-01-10T06:54:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	what was the link to the script again?>
2011-01-10T06:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2011-01-10T06:56:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	 i downloaded the script but i need something to open it with?
2011-01-10T06:57:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	the links page tells you how
2011-01-10T06:58:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	my bad. maybe i should read first huh?
2011-01-10T06:58:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	thats what that multitasking will do to yah.:)\
2011-01-10T06:59:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	on another note, i tried to re-install 10.10 earlier and it hung after i clicked install for like 10 minutes and i gave up
2011-01-10T07:00:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	what is the ram amount on the computer
2011-01-10T07:00:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	1gig i think...its what i had installed earlier and it worked fine
2011-01-10T07:01:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	also, the script is at "Searching sdal for information", and its kiiinda not moving
2011-01-10T07:01:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	hard to say really what is going on but the script will show any boot anaomalies amongst other things
2011-01-10T07:01:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	time to wait it out i suppose
2011-01-10T07:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	the script should run in less then 5 seconds
2011-01-10T07:03:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	i had three lines "Identifying MBRs...", "Computing Partition Table of /dev/sda...", and "Searching sdal for information...". Right now, the cursor is flashing at the beginning of the line, and it doesnt say ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ as it usually does
2011-01-10T07:04:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	so apparently the process is still running
2011-01-10T07:04:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	where is the script downloaded to
2011-01-10T07:05:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	/Downloads
2011-01-10T07:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	did you copy and paste the command or type it so it was pointed at tyhe download, and did you cpatilize the Download
2011-01-10T07:07:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	 i typed it out as "sudo bash ~/Downloads/boot_info_script*.sh"
2011-01-10T07:08:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	strange that it is not running, can you open gparted and look to see if it is reading the hard drive and if any flags are on any partitions.
2011-01-10T07:09:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	 it has 3 partitions...im not sure why...but the main one is /dev/sda1 with the flag boot
2011-01-10T07:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	post a screen shot of gparted as well

2011-01-10T07:16:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	I think you have some hardware problems or a HD that is old, how old is the HD?
2011-01-10T07:17:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	a couple of years i think..nothing rediculous
2011-01-10T07:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	alright
2011-01-10T07:20:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	so i tried to boot from thd hd for kicks and all i get is a flashing cursor with no text and its not booting anything...
2011-01-10T07:21:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	i think i screwed with the partitions and erased the boot files or moved them or idk what
2011-01-10T07:23:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	so it sounds like something happened how do you think I can help?
2011-01-10T07:23:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	 well mainly im not sure lol at this point i want top reinstall but it freezes and its not the disk i dont think
2011-01-10T07:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	you could use the alternative disc, but your the one there. How exsperienced are you at this?
2011-01-10T07:25:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	relatively, in that ive installed a few times
2011-01-10T07:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	if the install is not working you might try rebooting and running a memerory check at that first window.
2011-01-10T07:26:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	 i just googled my issue and it seems relatively common for a freeze at this screen
2011-01-10T07:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	WhatToDo	never have freezes in mine not sure what your doing or where from.
2011-01-10T07:28:00.000Z	WhatToDo	nit-wit	im trying to install 10.10 and its the first screen after you click install that says Preparing to install Ubuntu and you choose whether to install updates while installing. I click forward and the cursor goes in circles and doesnt advance
