2010-05-20T12:25:00.000Z	optical		then you run that downloaded NVIDIA driver as root
2010-05-20T12:25:00.000Z	optical		and pick yes

2010-05-20T12:26:00.000Z	optical		then it will recompile and update your Xconfig file
2010-05-20T12:26:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	I'm not getting x
2010-05-20T12:26:00.000Z	optical		then you just reboot once more and all is good

2010-05-20T12:29:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	I tried the solution posted by bashphoenux and have posted the result for each command. You can take a look
2010-05-20T12:29:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	BTW how to run the NVIDIA file??
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	optical		Krishnandu:
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	optical		type sudo ./NVIDIA(tab)
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	yup??
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	optical		it should autocomplete the filename
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	okies....
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	optical		and run it
2010-05-20T12:30:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	that will be ok??
2010-05-20T12:31:00.000Z	optical		well if it works it should bring you into an installer program
2010-05-20T12:31:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	one more query....I'm in windows now. So if I download the file how would i get this windows drive there in ubuntu??
2010-05-20T12:31:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	I don't know the mount command
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	I used to mount them from GUI
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	optical	Krishnandu	 well its easiest just to download it in ubuntu.  when low grapahics mode boots up, choose "stay in low graphics mode" then boot into X
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	optical		then go to the nvidia URL i gave you
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	optical		above
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	optical		and download the file
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	optical		then reboot, and next time choose Close X and go to console
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	optical		and the file shoudl be where you downloaded it to
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	There the problem comes......no screen....I'm if I choose to stay in low graphics mode nothing comes at all
2010-05-20T12:32:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	I waited from 5-10mins since yesterday many times
2010-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	optical	Krishnandu	hmm, strange
2010-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	optical		mine will go into low graphcis desktop
2010-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	optical		very low resolution and large fonts
2010-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	wekk should I try it again?? Or anything else I should do now??
2010-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	optical		you could just download it with wget instead
2010-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	optical		and not boot into X at all
2010-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	optical	Krishnandu	 OK do this instead.  Reboot into ubuntu, pick exit to console, and then when in the console and logged in, type " wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/195.36.24/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-195.36.24-pkg1.run "
2010-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	optical		that will download the file for you
2010-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	optical		then once the file is downloaded, type chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86-195.36.24-pkg1.run
2010-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	optical		then sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-195.36.24-pkg1.run
2010-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	optical		done
2010-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	Krishnandu		<khafiz> http://techie-buzz.com/foss/ubuntu-10-04-lts-installation-guide.html
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	Yup I did that. And then It downloaded a file
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	optical		good
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	optical		then type sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-195.36.24-pkg1.run
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	optical		and it will run the installer
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	Krishnandu	optical	after that i typed sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-pkg1.run
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	optical		well the filename isnt called that
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	optical		its called NVIDIA-Linux-x86-195.36.24-pkg1.run
2010-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	optical		if you downloaded the right one.

2010-05-20T12:37:00.000Z	optical	Krishnandu	 yes I saw there, those commands arent how i do it and havent tried that way.
