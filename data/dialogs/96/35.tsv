2008-05-04T04:15:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	you installed amsn via apt/synaptic?
2008-05-04T04:16:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	yes..via apt and via synaptic
2008-05-04T04:16:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	and when you ran apt-get install amsn, what did you see happen? an error, or successfully isntalled./
2008-05-04T04:16:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	well which was it apt or synaptic ;)
2008-05-04T04:17:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	sucessfully installed...but gives me error when trying to run..following the error:
2008-05-04T04:17:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	/usr/bin/wish: error while loading shared libraries: libtcl8.5.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2008-05-04T04:17:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	are you loading it by clicking its icon? or trying from the terminal?
2008-05-04T04:17:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	im not sure..but i think the same error happened when installing
2008-05-04T04:18:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	from the terminal
2008-05-04T04:18:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	'sudo apt-get install tcl8.5', after that completes, then use the icon on the menu to start amsn.
2008-05-04T04:18:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	ok..i'll try it now
2008-05-04T04:19:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	however if tcl8.5 wasnt installed with amsn, then we have a bug.
2008-05-04T04:19:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	anothe message: it tells me that tcl8.5 is already the newer version
2008-05-04T04:20:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	actually, amsn requires tcl8.5 to be installed, this is fairly odd
2008-05-04T04:20:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	it tells me that tcl8.5 is already the newer version
2008-05-04T04:21:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	do NOT install those packages in that forum thread, that is very antiquated
2008-05-04T04:22:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	ok man
2008-05-04T04:24:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	open a terminal, and try this "sudo apt-get remove --purge amsn && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install amsn"
2008-05-04T04:24:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	I'll try
2008-05-04T04:24:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	just a minute

2008-05-04T04:28:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	paste it to a pastebin please.

2008-05-04T04:32:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	your using a bunch of non-official ubuntu repos, automatix being one of them, good luck fixing it.
2008-05-04T04:32:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	is it easy to fix it?
2008-05-04T04:32:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	If I were you I'd remove all that 3rd party garbage repos from my /etc/apt/sources.list and ONLY use official ubuntu repos.
2008-05-04T04:33:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	I see...i'll do that
2008-05-04T04:34:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	yeah remove the automatix ones, and the sunnet.de ones, and debian-multimedia
2008-05-04T04:36:00.000Z	gleyve	macd	I removed them..do i need to restart my computer?
2008-05-04T04:36:00.000Z	macd	gleyve	no, rerun the command I gave you earlier.
