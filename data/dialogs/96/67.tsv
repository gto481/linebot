2006-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	did you install it with synaptic?
2006-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	no, from the package on the website
2006-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	opera
2006-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	does it have you run an install script, or do you compile it?
2006-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	it's already installed, I ran dpkg, if that tells you anything
2006-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	I'm not entirely familier with all the linux terminology yet
2006-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	oh, it's a dpkg package
2006-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	no I just want to get it working again, it stopped working
2006-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	what does it say if you try to run it from a command prompt
2006-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	I feel like a huge n00b for asking this, but... how do you run it from the command prompt?
2006-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	just "run opera"?
2006-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	I know how to get to terminal, just not how to use half of it >.<
2006-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	then try 'opera' then enter
2006-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	alright, it just gave me an error
2006-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	a long one?
2006-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	ERROR: ld.so: object 'libjvm.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
2006-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yea, just a bit
2006-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	and it used to work?
2006-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yes
2006-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	although, it used to give me a weird error message whenever I ran it
2006-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	looks like you hosed something on accident, any idea what you have been doing that would mess things up?
2006-03-21T09:11:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	nothing I can think of, the only thing that I've done since then is mess with my gnome theme and try to find a package to make quicktime files play in firefox
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	have you installed java?
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	don't think so
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	"find a package to make quicktime files play in firefox" could maybe mess things up
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	both of those .so files are related to java
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	how so? I just used synaptic
2006-03-21T09:13:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	k, so what should I do, try installing java to get those two files?
2006-03-21T09:13:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats?action=show&redirect=Java
2006-03-21T09:13:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	that has intructions to install java
2006-03-21T09:14:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	maybe try reinstalling first
2006-03-21T09:14:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	are you tehre?
2006-03-21T09:14:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yea
2006-03-21T09:15:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	try reinstalling opera you mean?
2006-03-21T09:15:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	yeah
2006-03-21T09:15:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	how did you install it? did you get a .deb file?
2006-03-21T09:15:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yes
2006-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	then from the command prompt you should be able to remove it with 'sudo dpkg -P name-of-package"
2006-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	the name of t he package is probably just opera
2006-03-21T09:17:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	kk
2006-03-21T09:20:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	just reinstalled, still not working
2006-03-21T09:21:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	you removed it and then installed it again?
2006-03-21T09:21:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	no errors?
2006-03-21T09:21:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yes
2006-03-21T09:22:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	then my only other recommendation besides installing java is to uninstall it again, and then install it with apt-get as explained in the wiki
2006-03-21T09:22:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	I tried to install Blackdown Java from apt-get and it won't work
2006-03-21T09:22:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	I don't konw what that it
2006-03-21T09:23:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	thats the java version it has in the wiki, besides sun
2006-03-21T09:23:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	the java you need is not listed because it's proprietary (unrestricted)
2006-03-21T09:24:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	damnit the installation instructions are a bitch though >.<
2006-03-21T09:24:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	yeah, they're pretty good
2006-03-21T09:25:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	when you say you tried blakcdown java and it doesn't work does that mean opera doesn't work or blackdown?
2006-03-21T09:26:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	blackdown java
2006-03-21T09:26:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	to rename like Madpilot says, 'mv .opera .opera_old'
2006-03-21T09:26:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	gives me an error when I tryed to apt-get it
2006-03-21T09:26:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	so it wouldn't install?
2006-03-21T09:26:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yea
2006-03-21T09:26:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	dependency?
2006-03-21T09:27:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	try renaming your .opera file and see if that fixes it
2006-03-21T09:28:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	trying to find it now
2006-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	alright, I can't rename it, the option is unselectable. It's cause I'm not in root right?
2006-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	or not running sudo
2006-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	hmm it shouldn't be
2006-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	did you try from a command line?
2006-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	no
2006-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	type 'ls -l opera' from the command line and tell me the permissions
2006-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	...it says "no such file or directory"
2006-03-21T09:35:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	gives me a realy long list of stuff
2006-03-21T09:36:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	yeah just realized that. lets just try renaming it -- mv .opera .opera_old
2006-03-21T09:37:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	alright, now what?
2006-03-21T09:37:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	no errors? Then try running opera
2006-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	you didn't have to 'sudo' it right?
2006-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	no I didn
2006-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	ran again, got the same error
2006-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	opera again that is
2006-03-21T09:39:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	should I just try and do java now? do you think that would solve my problem?
2006-03-21T09:40:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	that means it is something wrong with the system. It's segmentation fault that is killing you, not necessarily the java errors
2006-03-21T09:40:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	so what can I do about that?
2006-03-21T09:40:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	k
2006-03-21T09:40:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	what about my system problems?
2006-03-21T09:40:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	good luck
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	k, thanks for all the help
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	not sure -- still just something affecting opera
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	keep trying here (I don't know that much)
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	k, I guess I'll figure it out eventually
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	you know more than I do
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	and use firefox until then?  :)
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	yea
2006-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	petaruwaru	oblib	guess I'll split to then
2006-03-21T09:42:00.000Z	oblib	petaruwaru	all it takes to learn what I know is to try to set up MythTV. Whew
