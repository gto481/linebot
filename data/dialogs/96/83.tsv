2005-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	Davey		man I love cable :)
2005-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	Davey		Hey Amaranth :)
2005-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	!
2005-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	fancy finding you here ;)
2005-06-04T10:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	that's nothing, watch this :)
2005-06-04T10:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	:D
2005-06-04T10:00:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	damn dude, I'm gonna tap you for all your Ubuntu-fu :)
2005-06-04T10:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	That won't take long, I don't have much. ;)
2005-06-04T10:01:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	pfft
2005-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Make sure you get Smeg, GNOME 2.10 doesn't have a menu editor.
2005-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	Smeg?
2005-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	http://www.realistanew.com/projects/smeg/
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Nope, different formats.
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	The DVD ISO has all of main on it though, iirc.
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	So it's worth it to get it.
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	but I just finished downloading the CD ISO
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	So get a CD-R. ;)
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Oh, and unless you like pain don't upgrade to breezy.
2005-06-04T10:15:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	I wasn't going to ;)
2005-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	You actually read the topic? You're a dying breed around here, it seems. :)
2005-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	I didn't even know what breezy was when I read the topic, but I'm still a linux n00b, stable is fine for me ;)
2005-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	actually, I guess Ubuntu stable relates closer to Debian testing which I used use on my server
2005-06-04T10:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	any luck?
2005-06-05T12:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	m100, iirc
2005-06-05T12:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Maybe something like http://dev.realistanew.com/megatokyo.png ? :)
2005-06-05T12:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	bootsplash planned for breezy, i think someone maybe one for hoary
2005-06-05T12:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	geeks want to know what their computer is doing, newbs can ignore all the words scrolling by ;)
2005-06-05T12:17:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	pfft, I hate seeing it
2005-06-05T12:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Trying to get rid of 1 and keep 2? :)
2005-06-05T12:45:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	yes
2005-06-05T12:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Don't worry about ubuntu-desktop, you don't need it
2005-06-05T12:45:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	I will when breezy reaches release ;)
2005-06-05T12:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	The one in breezy depends on OOo2 stuff anyway, so you'll be fine when it comes time to upgrade.
2005-06-06T15:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	besides the fact that it sucks?
2005-06-06T15:21:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	you use FF+TB?
2005-06-06T15:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	firefox, yeah
2005-06-06T15:22:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	the script in Hoary to pass e-mail address to TB when its running is b0rke, trying to find a fix :/
2005-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	the only time i've seen that work is with a 2003 copy of wine
2005-06-18T10:59:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	Smeg (latest) does not work for me :/
2005-06-20T09:29:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	!
2005-06-24T08:48:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	!
2005-06-24T08:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	hey
2005-06-24T08:49:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	hows it going? :)
2005-06-24T08:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	ok, i guess
2005-06-24T08:49:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	Ubuntu is the first Linux distro I've used for more than 24hrs at a time :D
2005-06-24T08:49:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	and Smeg has played its part I'll tell you :D
2005-06-24T08:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	I try. :)
2005-07-09T09:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Ubuntu users
2005-07-09T09:00:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	lame ;)
2005-07-09T09:00:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	I got PHP5 working just fine :)
2005-07-09T09:01:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	heck, I'm using CVS HEAD as of 5 minutes ago :)
2005-07-20T14:19:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	dude!
2005-08-05T11:29:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	Ubuntu hates me :(
2005-08-05T11:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	What'd you break this time?
2005-08-06T12:18:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	wheres my Smeg 0.8? :)
2005-08-06T12:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	http://dev.realistanew.com/smeg-devel/loading_everything.png <--in progress
2005-08-06T12:18:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	copy and paste btw? ::)
2005-08-06T12:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	?
2005-08-06T12:18:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	possible?
2005-08-06T12:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	It was before my HD crashed and I had to start over.
2005-08-06T12:19:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	add it back :)
2005-08-06T12:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Yesterday I did in one day what took me one month before, I'm taking a break. :P
2005-08-06T12:20:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	pfft
2005-08-06T12:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	btw, like my logo?
2005-08-06T12:25:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	where?
2005-08-06T12:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	http://dev.realistanew.com/smeg-devel/loading_everything.png
2005-08-06T12:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	I stole it from the tools icon. :)
2005-08-06T12:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	I just made the goofy little menu and put another icon on top of it.
2005-09-29T11:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	some generic GE thing
2005-09-29T11:25:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	so, breezy is pretty stable now?
2005-09-29T11:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	somewhat, they are getting in some last minute things and there are some problems with x-common
2005-09-29T11:31:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	so, uhm, Smeg is default in 2.12? Good job dude :D
2005-09-29T11:36:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	what keyboard do you use?
2005-09-29T11:53:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	I've been struggling with my keyboard for months, the media keys weren't doing the right stuff
2005-09-29T11:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Language.
2005-09-29T11:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	That's....odd.
2005-09-29T11:54:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	turns out, I just had to hit the connect button on the base and the keyboard to re-detect it... and voila :/
2005-09-29T11:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	lmao
2005-09-29T11:55:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	that sucks so bad :/
2005-09-30T10:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	don't suppose you've using mcrypt in C before. :)
2005-09-30T10:35:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	never even used C before ;)
2005-09-30T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	wow, that's odd :)
2005-09-30T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	i'm being forced to use it, otherwise i'd stick to python
2005-09-30T10:36:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	not really :)
2005-10-24T09:02:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	Breezy is *nice* :)
2005-10-24T09:02:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	but not much has changed :/
2005-10-24T09:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	:D
2005-10-24T09:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Well, lots of little things have changed.
2005-10-24T09:03:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	hated those stupid buttons instead of location text box shit, turned that off really quickly ;)
2005-10-24T09:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	And if you're using it on a laptop you'll notice a lot of the changes.
2005-10-24T09:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Wanna test the new version of smeg for me? I need someone to try to break it so I can pick up the pieces.
2005-10-24T09:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	Or just use the breadcrumbs and hit ctrl-l when you really need the location entry
2005-10-24T09:06:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	catch me tomorrow, I'm off to bed :)
2005-10-24T09:06:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	but then I'll be happy to test... as little as I edit my menus ;)
2005-10-24T09:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	Davey	I need people who don't edit them much, in case you break something. The only fix is removing all your changes.
2005-10-24T09:07:00.000Z	Davey	Amaranth	ah, cool :)
