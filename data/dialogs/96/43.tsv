2008-01-22T08:34:00.000Z	bod_		hey guys ,.,. in windows u could make a virtual memory swap folder to increase ur ram,.,. can u do this in ubuntu?
2008-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	that's what the swap partition is for
2008-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	but swap doesn't increase the amount of RAM you have
2008-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	but it will speed my computer up a bit yer?
2008-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	no
2008-01-22T08:35:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	so wot does it do?
2008-01-22T08:36:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	using swap is slower than using RAM, since swap is on the hard drive, and hard drives are slow
2008-01-22T08:36:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	it allows applications to use more memory
2008-01-27T08:36:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	thanks
2008-01-27T08:37:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	 i use killall,.,. thanks for clearing up what they do
2008-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	yeah I typically use killall, unless there's more than one instance of a process running, and I only want to kill one (for example, "killall bash" would be a bad idea)
2008-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	lol,. yer dont do that,.,.lol
2008-01-27T08:40:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	better would be /media/My\ Ipod
2008-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	it's not better, I just like to say it is, because quotes are also the character of the devil.
2008-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	lol,.,. ok
2008-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	but /media/"My Ipod" is wrong; it's "/media/My Ipod"
2008-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	 ok cheers,.,. wasnt to sure
2008-01-27T08:49:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	I would imagine so
2008-01-27T08:50:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	will that be out from the beginning or will we have to wait longer for a 64?
2008-01-27T08:50:00.000Z	nemilar	bod_	not sure, but I think they normally release at the same time
2008-01-27T08:50:00.000Z	bod_	nemilar	cool,.,.cheers
