2005-10-29T11:42:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	how do i give it proper privs?
2005-10-29T11:43:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	i dont know, i dont run root things when i start up my box
2005-10-29T11:43:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	ack
2005-10-29T11:43:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	when it says username, do i do just my login name , or my name and my boxes name
2005-10-29T11:44:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	your username
2005-10-29T11:45:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	yeah it says i do not have root user priveleges to use Firestarter..
2005-10-29T11:45:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	perhaps you should approach your goal from another direction
2005-10-29T11:46:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	i know of no other direction
2005-10-29T11:47:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	perhaps in system > preferences > sessions, you put "gksudo firestarter" ?
2005-10-29T11:48:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	what is gksudo?
2005-10-29T11:48:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	i have sudo firestarter atm :P
2005-10-29T11:48:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	a gtk frontend to 'sudo'
2005-10-29T11:49:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	does that prevent asking for a password ?
2005-10-29T11:49:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	it will prompt you when you log into gnome
2005-10-29T11:52:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	that worked, but i have to type in my PW now
2005-10-29T11:52:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	any way to make it not need a password?
2005-10-29T11:53:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	there are ways, but they lead to security issues
2005-10-29T11:53:00.000Z	dmlinux	nalioth	ah nm then
2005-10-30T15:40:00.000Z	nalioth	dmlinux	enable powersaving and let your display depower
