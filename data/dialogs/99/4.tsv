2011-06-09T04:46:00.000Z	macnix		I have the most annoying network interface problem on 10.04.02 64bit which I just can't figure out
2011-06-09T04:47:00.000Z	macnix		ifconfig output is good, I can ping it, but none of the services are available
2011-06-09T04:47:00.000Z	macnix		it just hangs when I try to connect via ssh or http to anything but the primary IP
2011-06-09T04:48:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	check the router config?
2011-06-09T04:48:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	this is a server with an ISP, don't have access to the router
2011-06-09T04:49:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	does your isp allow you to run it remotely?
2011-06-09T04:49:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	this is the full picture https://gist.github.com/93472542fb4d0ca5cc27
2011-06-09T04:49:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	you mean run nmap remotely?
2011-06-09T04:49:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	yes
2011-06-09T04:50:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	does it show the right ports as interesting?
2011-06-09T04:53:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	if I run traceroutes to the IPs, they stop at the firewall so I can't get to the actual machines, to confirm that the IPs have been allocated correctly
2011-06-09T04:53:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	but they all respond to pings and they didn't until I set them up on the server
2011-06-09T04:54:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	I have NEVER had this problem before on Ubuntu and did quiet a few multi-IP setups
2011-06-09T04:54:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	it really doesn't seem like an ubuntu problem. sounds like a network setup issue. 1 sec.
2011-06-09T04:55:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	that's what I thought, but I need ammo if I'm going to tell the biggest DC in Europe that they got their network config screwed :D
2011-06-09T05:01:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	what is the output of route -n?
2011-06-09T05:03:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	sorry, got a brew
2011-06-09T05:09:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	updated the pastie with route -n output https://gist.github.com/93472542fb4d0ca5cc27
2011-06-09T05:09:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	direct link https://gist.github.com/93472542fb4d0ca5cc27#file_route_n.output.sh
2011-06-09T05:16:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	any ideas?
2011-06-09T05:16:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	no, everything looks ok . . . still working on it though
2011-06-09T05:17:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	cool, thanks
2011-06-09T05:17:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	I attempted to figure out a fix twice, with a few days in between, so I've triple checked everything on my end
2011-06-09T05:17:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	it feels like I'm missing something, but I don't know what
2011-06-09T05:18:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	think I took my networking experience as far as I could : )
2011-06-09T05:19:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	have  you restarted networking?
2011-06-09T05:19:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	yes, like 10 times :)
2011-06-09T05:20:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	that seems like an issue.
2011-06-09T05:22:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	taking its time to come back up..
2011-06-09T05:23:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	related maybe? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ifupdown/+bug/663352
2011-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	spot on!
2011-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	reading about it...
2011-06-09T05:26:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	hmm, from what I read, that bug refers to the desktop version
2011-06-09T05:27:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	it might apply to other versions also, just noticed there. is your computing machine back up?
2011-06-09T05:27:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	yes
2011-06-09T05:28:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	does ifconfig eth0:1 give you anything?
2011-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	so all 3 IPs appear in ifconfig (same as in my pastie)
2011-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	nmap only returns the open ports for eth0, nothing for eth0:0 or eth0:1
2011-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	nmap reports them as being down: Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.42 seconds
2011-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	but ifconfig reports them as being up...
2011-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	i trust nmap :/
2011-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	this is really pulling my leg right now
2011-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	me too
2011-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	so where is the disconnect?
2011-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	how many software engineers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? trick question - that's a hardware problem :)
2011-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	not sure about that, but i am checking now. situation just brought that winner of a joke to mind.
2011-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	hehe, good one :)
2011-06-09T05:36:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	it could be a nic thing. i might be wrong, but i don't think *all* network cards support multiple ips.
2011-06-09T05:36:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	it's a very decent NIC card... let me get the info
2011-06-09T05:36:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	NetXtreme BCM5723 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe
2011-06-09T05:37:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	HP ProLiant DL120  standard spec
2011-06-09T05:37:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	even the HDDs are HP FFS!!
2011-06-09T05:49:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	ok
2011-06-09T05:51:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	ssh server config?
2011-06-09T05:51:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	but then what about HTTP? It hangs just like SSH
2011-06-09T05:53:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	sshd has the default config, it's not bound to a specific address
2011-06-09T05:53:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	by default, AFAIK, it listens on all network interfaces
2011-06-09T05:56:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	can you ssh to either of the alias ips locally?
2011-06-09T05:56:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	no
2011-06-09T06:00:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	restart networking?
2011-06-09T06:00:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	output is: restart: Unknown instance:
2011-06-09T06:10:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	nc -zvw 1 <host_here> <port_here>
2011-06-09T06:11:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	all are successful
2011-06-09T06:11:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	but that's since the route add
2011-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	I ran that nc on the server
2011-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	running it locally it just hangs
2011-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	doing it remotely?
2011-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	hangs
2011-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	oh, hang on
2011-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	only for eth0:0 it hangs, eth0:1 seems fine
2011-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	let me try this a few times
2011-06-09T06:14:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	have you tried ssh to eth0:1?
2011-06-09T06:14:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	yes, eth0:1 works
2011-06-09T06:16:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	rename eth0:0 to eth0:2, restarting networking
2011-06-09T06:16:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	nice, we're getting somewhere
2011-06-09T06:19:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	rationalOgre ok, so I'm pretty sure someone else is using my IP address
2011-06-09T06:19:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	possible.
2011-06-09T06:19:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	rationalOgre not sure how that's possible, but otherwise SIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot assign requested address doesn't make sense
2011-06-09T06:21:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	nmap -A <ipaddress>
2011-06-09T06:23:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	is 2 the one you did the route add command on?
2011-06-09T06:23:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	I added them all, but when I restarted the networking, only the default route remained
2011-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	still, locally, I can ssh into any of the 3 IPs
2011-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	remotely, only into 1 & 3
2011-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	remotely do: nmap -A <ipaddress>
2011-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	I'm on OSX, need to install nmap first...
2011-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	will be a few mins
2011-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	can run it from a different host though...
2011-06-09T06:28:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	ok, got it
2011-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	IP2 has been taken by someone else
2011-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	going to do a pastie
2011-06-09T06:34:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	this is the ip you were trying to get? http://lexi.lazu.co.uk/  ??  http works on this one?
2011-06-09T06:35:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	but it is not you?
2011-06-09T06:35:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	yes, that's the machine. It has 3 IPs pointing to it
2011-06-09T06:36:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	all with proper PTR
2011-06-09T06:36:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	well, i just got to it using the ip you ran nmap with, so it seems to be working now.
2011-06-09T06:36:00.000Z	milamber	macnix	glad you got it resolved.
2011-06-09T06:38:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	the PTR is set in my ISPs control panel which checks it with the DNS servers. But because someone else has assigned it before, even if my end is all good, their network is routing all the traffic to that server.
2011-06-09T06:38:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	so they need to give me another IP and apologise profoundly for setting me on a wild goose chase
2011-06-09T06:38:00.000Z	macnix	milamber	and doubting ubuntu!!! imagine the travesty!!! :D
