2008-04-20T06:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	 thers a few fixes there
2008-04-20T06:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	looks like the sigtal modes can couse issues
2008-04-20T06:26:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	I just checked the digital output switch and it looks off (its set to zero)
2008-04-20T06:26:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	I don't know if that's the same as disabling?
2008-04-20T06:26:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	 sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer
2008-04-20T06:27:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	ok I will get it
2008-04-20T06:28:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	ok I'm reading
2008-04-20T06:29:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	I realized that and pushed M for mute :P
2008-04-20T06:33:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	i gotta go for now but search for  Creative Labs SB Audigy (rev 03)  you will get alot more info for your card then without the rev info :)
2008-04-20T06:34:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	thank you so much for your help
2008-04-20T06:34:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	it's still not working, but I'll keep trying
2008-04-20T07:14:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	good news!  It worked!  Now all I need to do is boost the volume somehow
2008-04-20T07:14:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	 ? with was it
2008-04-20T07:15:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	i say max it out in the mixer then crank up the speakers :)
2008-04-20T07:15:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	there was a whole bunch of switches in both system>preferences>sounds and the alsamixer that had the digital output enabled.  I had to disable those and raise the "center" portion
2008-04-20T07:16:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	then try raising em more
2008-04-20T07:16:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	just rember the old settings
2008-04-20T07:17:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	I raised them up as far as they go and there's still a huge difference.  Besides, I use headphones a little more than the actual speakers.
2008-04-20T07:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	lol check the headphones vulem thwn
2008-04-20T07:18:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	also check 3d sound any any boost system
2008-04-20T07:18:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	there is no headphone volume haha everything is all the way up.  It's funny cuz in 7.04, 50% of the volume was more than enough.  Now it's at 100% and it sounds decent
2008-04-20T07:18:00.000Z	Zeker_	gogeta	all the boosts are enabled as well
2008-04-20T07:19:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	stupid low tech but check the cable
2008-04-20T07:19:00.000Z	gogeta	Zeker_	mic lose can sound like low mode
