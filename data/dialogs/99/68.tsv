2009-05-16T06:30:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	 the -R option to do something with chmod or chown recursively
2009-05-16T07:18:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	all directories must be executable to access them.
2009-05-16T07:20:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so if you made the permissions _everything_ rw-r--r-- then you wouldn't be able to access anything because the directories wouldn't work.
2009-05-16T07:20:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I made /media/exteral which is my external drive 640. Is there anyway to ... fix it? The drive won't even mount now.
2009-05-16T07:21:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	did you say which filesystem it is?
2009-05-16T07:21:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	It's ext3
2009-05-16T07:21:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	and you can't mount it?
2009-05-16T07:21:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	no
2009-05-16T07:25:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so set  dmask=0022 as a boot option and try.
2009-05-16T07:25:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	boot option? How?
2009-05-16T07:26:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	mount -t ext3 -o dmask=0022 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/point
2009-05-16T07:26:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	the device and the mount point may need to change.
2009-05-16T07:26:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so you can put various mount options after the -o with commas inbetween each
2009-05-16T07:27:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	mount point doesn't exist. I guess I have to make it?
2009-05-16T07:27:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	yes
2009-05-16T07:27:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	mkdir /mnt/point     all this requires root (so sudo)
2009-05-16T07:28:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist
2009-05-16T07:28:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	that was just a guess.  This is an external drive?
2009-05-16T07:28:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Yes
2009-05-16T07:29:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I also think I assinged a UUID.
2009-05-16T07:29:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	does it only have one filesystem on it or multiple?
2009-05-16T07:29:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Just one.
2009-05-16T07:30:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	that was meant to you obviously.
2009-05-16T07:30:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Yes.
2009-05-16T07:30:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	at any rate.  you can do   ls /dev | grep sd
2009-05-16T07:31:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	to see what hard drive devices are available.
2009-05-16T07:31:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	or probably just do UUID=blabla  instead.
2009-05-16T07:32:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so to clarify:  the dmask=0022 option should instruct the permissions of directories to be 755.
2009-05-16T07:33:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	weird. Let me pastebin my fstab. there's an error on line 16
2009-05-16T07:34:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	http://pastebin.ca/1424304
2009-05-16T07:35:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	the $ should not be there.  Change it to two zeros with a space inbetween.
2009-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I guess I should restart now then?
2009-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Looks like a totally different problem though.
2009-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	no
2009-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	hmm
2009-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	do swapoff then swapon
2009-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	I meant no to restarting
2009-05-16T07:37:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so sudo swapoff; sudo swapon -a
2009-05-16T07:37:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so is either /dev/sda4 or /dev/sda2 the drive that you can't access?
2009-05-16T07:37:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I just did 2 commands, "sudo swapoff -a" and "swapon -a"
2009-05-16T07:38:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	then do    swapon -s
2009-05-16T07:38:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	if something appears, then you know that swap is working.
2009-05-16T07:39:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	The problem isn't with swap though. I tried to exit nano. I had /etc/fstab up, after it closed it said there was an error on like 16. Which is totally unrelated since my swap is on my internal drive rather than my external.
2009-05-16T07:39:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	And, it looks like my external drive isn't even in fstab.
2009-05-16T07:40:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	correct, but now swap is fixed because it must have gotten messed up when editing fstab
2009-05-16T07:40:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Or, someone got into my computer somehow and changed stuff.
2009-05-16T07:40:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so to discover what device it is:  plug it in.  run:  sudo parted          then at the prompt:  print all
2009-05-16T07:41:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Yeah the device isn't there. :)
2009-05-16T07:41:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	if you want to be paranoid... does some one know your password?  at any rate.  with the previous command you will get a listing of all your partitions.  Find the one that matches the filesystem you want to mount.
2009-05-16T07:42:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	It will say:  Disk /dev/sXX   note what XX is.       Then note the partition number below.
2009-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	with that info, you can retry the mount command.
2009-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	No one knows my password, no. My partition I want isn't listed there. I'm thinking the drive is fried, or the external case is garbage.
2009-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	perhaps.  But you said you chmod -R 644   right?
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	chmod 640
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	If you did that. to the drive, you would have made it impossible to access, because directories must be executable.
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	ok 640   the same result in this case.
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	directories should be 755
2009-05-16T07:45:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so, It seems odd that the disk would die right at that moment; much more likely you just need to mount it with dmask=0022 or similar
2009-05-16T07:47:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Not sure if you seen, but prior to all of this I asked what permission my external drive would be... I wanted, root: read and write, user: read, everyone else: none. Put I didn't know it needed to be executeable. so I went with 640, in which I think I wanted 740.
2009-05-16T07:47:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	can I mount with a UUID?
2009-05-16T07:47:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	yes.  Directories should be executable and files not ;(
2009-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	minimally in fstab, I have not ever used an UUID with a standard mount command.  Try!
2009-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	and I don't have any drives to test it on that are ext3
2009-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	that aren't already mounted.
2009-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I first need to find out the UUID, but if it's not mounted. I can't really. :P
2009-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	I find it hard to believe you can't find the device name.  That is a prerequisite for the UUID with vol_id anyway, right?
2009-05-16T07:50:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	assuming the drive works, something should appear either with parted  or in /dev when the drive is plugged in.
2009-05-16T07:51:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	sudo sfdisk -l   will give a list of partitions and their devices.
2009-05-16T07:54:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so you can just run:  blkid
2009-05-16T07:55:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	hmm, yeah. Not there. :) I don't know dude. This external enclosure is under warranty, so I think I may take it back tomorrow and see if that's the verdict. Thanks for the help. :)
2009-05-16T07:55:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	too bad it couldn't be fixed.  No problem, and good luck!
2009-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	... LOL. I was just fooling around with the power supply, and now ... the disk is spinning. I should have took notice at first. ;(
2009-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	one way to get a drive working... :)
2009-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Weird. blkid shows: /dev/sdb1: SEC_TYPE="msdos" LABEL="KINGSTON" UUID="E0FD-1813" TYPE="vfat"
2009-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Is that normal when it's not executeable?
2009-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	is that all it shows for /dev/sdb ?
2009-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Yes.
2009-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	because vfat will not store linux permissions anyway.
2009-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	It wasn't vfat in the first place.
2009-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	In other words, that doesn't look like ext3...
2009-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	can you mount it?
2009-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	It was... ext3. It says it's already mounted.
2009-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	mount: /dev/sdb1 already mounted or /media/external_ busy
2009-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	also mount: according to mtab, /dev/sdb1 is already mounted on /media/external_
2009-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	what does the output of "mount" say
2009-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	regarding what filesystem it is mounted as?
2009-05-16T08:03:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I can pastebin it, but the line I want(I think) is: /dev/sdb1 on /media/external_ type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal)
2009-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	What I might do is, umount /media/external_, delete /media/external I just created. And remount, or hope it remounts.
2009-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	odd. but blkid said it was vfat.  Now that you mention it. I have a /dev/sdb1 with blkid that also says it is vfat and I have no external drive attached.
2009-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	and /dev/sda3 says it is ext2 with blkid even though it is ext3
2009-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	I just did ls /media/external_ and it's listing the files.
2009-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	perhaps it is better to use something other than blkid in this case.
2009-05-16T08:06:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	good, so problem is solved.
2009-05-16T08:07:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	not yet. :P I need to rm -R /media/external && umount /media/external_ && mount /media/external/. I'll do it per command though.
2009-05-16T08:09:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	so you are trying to delete everything on the drive?  -r (or -R) is correct
2009-05-16T08:09:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	It's definitely a faulty case.
2009-05-16T08:09:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Just deleting an empty directory.
2009-05-16T08:10:00.000Z	jdu	J-_	sadly cases are often bad.
2009-05-16T08:12:00.000Z	J-_	jdu	Yeah for sure. I just turned the case off, and back on. Drive isn't spinning. So I guess I can fool around with this POS for a while until it decided it wants to turn on.
