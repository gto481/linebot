2006-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	JoeBlow		dude music in europe sucks, ive been living here a year, and its all pop
2006-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	JoeBlow		maybe its just germany
2006-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	JoeBlow		but the radio is terrible
2006-01-10T09:33:00.000Z	JoeBlow		anyway, if anyone has a few minutes of time, can someone help me with wine
2006-01-10T09:34:00.000Z	JoeBlow		but seriously, i cant get anything to load in wne, and i think i followed winehq's directions properly
2006-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	can't you even get notepad to run?
2006-01-10T09:37:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you're doing wrong
2006-01-10T09:37:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	also there's a q2 linux installer
2006-01-10T09:37:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	dont wine the windows one
2006-01-10T09:37:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	quake2 was just my test program
2006-01-10T09:38:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you're not supposed to type a smb style url to run a windows exe
2006-01-10T09:38:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	then how do i do it?
2006-01-10T09:38:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	and only very few windows application actually work. try something simple first, like notepad.exe
2006-01-10T09:39:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	wine /path/to/notepad.exe
2006-01-10T09:39:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	I doubt the windows installer for q2 will even run in wine
2006-01-10T09:40:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	ok I ran notepad, theirs a start
2006-01-10T09:40:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	good. then it works
2006-01-10T09:40:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you can only run a tiny fraction of windows apps in wine
2006-01-10T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	wine generally don't work with the apps I need it to run
2006-01-10T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	the have a compatiblity list
2006-01-10T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	it's like way less than one percent of all windows apps
2006-01-10T09:44:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	I still keep windows around so I can play my favorite games
2006-01-10T09:45:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	I am locked out of windows right now lol, because 64 bit version requires activation, and i dont have a 32 bit disk laying around
2006-01-10T09:46:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	I see. also I wouldn't recommend the 64 bit unubuntu version at this point
2006-01-10T09:46:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	there are simply too much stuff that don't work or work bad
2006-01-10T09:47:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	is their something free thats better then wine?
2006-01-10T09:47:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	no
2006-01-10T09:47:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	or is gaming on linux rightnow just really not happening?
2006-01-10T09:47:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you simply cannot run most windows apps in linux
2006-01-10T09:48:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	if you don't mind only playing those few games that work in linux you'll be ok. but like 99.99 of all games don't run in linux even with stuff like cedega
2006-01-10T09:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you can play most id games like q4. half-life 2 works too
2006-01-10T09:49:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	all i play is quake 2, and hl2
2006-01-10T09:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	good then
2006-01-10T09:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	but I doubt youll get it to work in 64bit ubuntu
2006-01-10T09:49:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	I just gotta find a way to get quake 2 working
2006-01-10T09:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	use the 32bit version instead
2006-01-10T09:50:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	Im on 32 bit
2006-01-10T09:50:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	good
2006-01-10T09:50:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	just google icculus
2006-01-10T09:50:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	he did the quake2 for linux and there's a good guide as well
2006-01-10T09:51:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	ill check it out, thnx
2006-01-10T09:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	beware that getting steam to run in linux takes some dedication though
2006-01-12T09:16:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	thank you
2006-01-12T09:16:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you're welcome

2006-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	, mount: can't find /dev/hdb3 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2006-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	if it can't detect the file system you need mount -t <fs_type> though
2006-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	type it like I told you to
2006-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	mount /dev/hdb /mnt/<mountpoint>
2006-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	mount /dev/hdb3 /mnt/<mountpoint>
2006-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	that is
2006-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	oh crap, i forgot the /mnt/boot
2006-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	mkdir -p /mnt/hdb3 && mount /dev/hdb3 /mnt/hdb3
2006-01-12T09:44:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	ok i got it mounted
2006-01-12T09:44:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	great

2006-01-12T09:46:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	what are you trying to do?
2006-01-12T09:46:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	/sbin/grub-install /dev/hdb
2006-01-12T09:47:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	I only know how to use the grub shell. did you read the wiki?
2006-01-12T09:47:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	yea
2006-01-12T09:48:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	sure you didn't miss anything, like the chroot if you wanna do it automatically?
2006-01-12T09:48:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	it didnt say anythignabout chroot in wili
2006-01-12T09:48:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	wiki
2006-01-12T09:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	well here it does: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-01-12T09:50:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	on what part, im on that page
2006-01-12T09:50:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	oh shit, ok i see it
2006-01-12T09:50:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	about a page down, just before "Recovering GRUB Automatically"
2006-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	I never even had to touch that part before, ive installed grub about 5 times this week, and this is the first trouble its given me, i could have done it by memory before this
2006-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	ok
2006-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	just run "grub" and do it manually. that should work
2006-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	thats how i was doing it, and it wasnt working, was it because the hd wasnt mounted?
2006-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	in that case you can forget about chroot
2006-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	no
2006-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	what was the error. be careful about typing the right partitions
2006-01-12T10:32:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	hey can uhelp me out with manual grub install, it tells me my disk does not exist
2006-01-12T10:34:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	you need to give it the correct disk and partition
2006-01-12T10:34:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	im using hdb3, i tell it (hd1,2)
2006-01-12T10:35:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	looks ok. use tab completion to see what it recognizes
2006-01-12T10:35:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	how do i do that?
2006-01-12T10:36:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	type root(hd<tab> in the grub shell
2006-01-12T10:37:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	it just repeats what i wrote, doesnt add any numbers
2006-01-12T10:39:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	any ideas, i know the drives mounted, ive browsed it
2006-01-12T10:40:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	so root(hd1,2) doesn't work?
2006-01-12T10:44:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	right
2006-01-12T11:09:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	i think its unix
2006-01-12T11:10:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	do you what unix then?
2006-01-12T11:10:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	no, i want ubuntu
2006-01-12T11:10:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	but it is giving me trouble with install
2006-01-24T15:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	don't run wine with sudo
2006-01-24T15:50:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	ok
2006-01-24T15:51:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	If i dont, it tells me "Setup has detected the install shield is already in use, please close it then try again" , And its not
2006-01-24T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	I don't know. did you run wine with sudo the first time?
2006-01-24T15:52:00.000Z	JoeBlow	mwe	yea
2006-01-24T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	.wine has wrong permissions then
2006-01-24T15:53:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	sudo chown -R JoeBlow:JoeBlow ~/.wine
2006-01-24T15:53:00.000Z	mwe	JoeBlow	or whatever your login name is
