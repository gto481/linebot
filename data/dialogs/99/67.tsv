2008-03-28T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	many
2008-03-28T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	use synaptic to search
2008-03-28T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	thats jubjective, try them and se which one suits your needs
2008-03-28T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I'm  fan of vsftp
2008-03-28T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	thats not going to give you time to get an opinion then, just pick one and run with it
2008-03-28T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	open synaptic and search for ftp
2008-03-28T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	client
2008-03-28T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	the descrption should tell you
2008-03-28T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	what does it say
2008-03-28T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	no - what does the apt-get error say
2008-03-28T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	then a webserver may be better than ftp
2008-03-28T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	that package doesn't exist
2008-03-28T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I told you to search using synaptic
2008-03-28T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	either pick an ftp server, or use a webserver
2008-03-28T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	a webserver will be the easy way to share stuff to her, or as you've said, use an ftp user
2008-03-28T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	because it doesn't exist
2008-03-28T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	as I've said 2 times now, use synaptic to server for ftp and install one of the servers it shows up
2008-03-28T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	synaptic to search and install an ftp server
2008-03-28T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I told you to search for ftp
2008-03-28T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	not ftp server
2008-03-28T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	so pick one
2008-03-28T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	thats YOUR choice, either try some or pick one at random
2008-03-28T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I like vsftp
2008-03-28T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	but whats good for one is poor for another pick one, try some
2008-03-28T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	no
2008-03-28T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	not gui
2008-03-28T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	read the docs
2008-03-28T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	there is a good man page on it

2008-03-28T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	how can you not understand the guide when you don't have the URL (you keep asking me for the URL)
2008-03-28T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	please show me the guide your using that doesn't make sense and I'll walk you through it
2008-03-28T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	ok, what part of that are you not understanding ?
2008-03-28T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	you have installed vstpd yes/no ?
2008-03-28T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	ok, have you looked at the file /etc/vsftpd.conf as the guide says
2008-03-28T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	they are not scripts or code - they are plain text config files
2008-03-28T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	then why did you say they are script / code ?
2008-03-28T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I told you earlier gftp is a client only
2008-04-22T16:36:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	everyone in #winehq does
2008-04-22T16:36:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	for specialist questions
2008-04-22T16:37:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	ok, so wait around for them to respond
2008-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	gksu is for X11 apps

2008-08-05T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I assume this is over msn ?
2008-08-05T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	pidgin should be fine sending to msn
2008-08-05T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	possibly your network/router/isp then
2008-08-05T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	no sorry,
2008-08-05T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	you've confirmed that piding/amsn can send to msn by testing with yourself, so therefore you know they are not the problem
2008-08-05T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	I'm pretty sure it does
2008-08-05T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	one moment
2008-08-05T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	kelvin911	seems to work fine
