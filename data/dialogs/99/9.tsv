2010-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	ikonia		swapping libc out is not a good idea
2010-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	total four files
2010-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	I know, but I think we get the message
2010-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	hmm
2010-09-19T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	what is the issue ?
2010-09-19T17:07:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i just installed previous version of linux kernle i.e. #23 and removedd the latest one i.e. #24 but now i in update it dont show any update for kernels.
2010-09-19T17:08:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	actionParsnip should i again just manualy install the latest kernal #25?
2010-09-19T17:08:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	I'd check to make sure it's not still installed
2010-09-19T17:08:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yah i removed the latest kernel with ubuntu tweak
2010-09-19T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	ahhh ubuntu tweak = your system is no longer supported
2010-09-19T17:09:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	:)
2010-09-19T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	why you felt the need to use ubuntu tweek when the supported package manager tools are there I don't know
2010-09-19T17:09:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i just read on some blog that tweak is easy gui to do day to day ubutnu things
2010-09-19T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	you read wrong
2010-09-19T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	can you use synaptic ?
2010-09-19T17:10:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes i can
2010-09-19T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	ok - so why did you need to use unsupported software to remove a software package
2010-09-19T17:10:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	dunno. i felt if fancy and good
2010-09-19T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	well, your system is now unsupportible
2010-09-19T17:11:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	so what you suggest now? should i uninstall ubuntu tweak?
2010-09-19T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	too late, you don't know what it's changed, how and why, your system is now in an unsupportable state
2010-09-19T17:11:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	so reinstall is the only solution?
2010-09-19T17:12:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i mean reinstall os
2010-09-19T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	up to you
2010-09-19T17:12:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i want my system to be supportable. what to do?
2010-09-19T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	up to you
2010-09-19T17:13:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	:(
2010-09-19T17:17:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	do you mean that using synaptic to remove kernel whould have not caused this problem? so that i wll use synpatic in next time
2010-09-19T17:18:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i am asking your suggestion
2010-10-03T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	no, it's fine as it is
2010-10-03T19:33:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	ok :)
2010-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i insatll hylafax. but where it goes? cant find it
2010-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	how did you install it ?
2010-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	sudo apt-get insatll hylafax-client
2010-10-08T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	so it should be somewhere in /usr/bin I believe
2010-10-08T13:20:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	ok
2010-10-08T13:21:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	why are you showing me that ?
2010-10-08T13:21:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	because it is not runnig. when i type hylafax in termianl it says command not found
2010-10-16T13:21:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	it's not that simple,
2010-10-16T13:22:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yah

2010-11-20T18:18:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	and still it is not working
2010-11-20T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	did all the steps in the install process work
2010-11-20T18:20:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	im using lts. so i double click on font. and it told me that it got installed. and still it is not working
2010-11-20T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	how did you check ?

2010-11-20T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	run suco fc-cache -f -b
2010-11-20T18:21:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	and thing is arora is displaying that website well but frefox is not

2010-11-20T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	typo
2010-11-20T18:23:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	fc-cache succeded. and still not working in firefox
2010-11-20T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	firefox should pickup fonts from the font server, have you restarted firefox
2010-11-20T18:24:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes restarted
2010-11-20T18:25:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	chromium and arora did successfully picked up the font. but firefox not :(
2010-11-20T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	you are using firefox from the repos yes ?
2010-11-20T18:25:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes
2010-11-20T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	it should pickup from font server.

2011-02-05T19:42:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/UrHDDUDs
2011-02-05T19:43:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	and you're still seeing .27 in your grub menu  ?
2011-02-05T19:43:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes
2011-02-05T19:43:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	Hmmmm have you run update-grub ?
2011-02-05T19:43:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes 3 times
2011-02-05T19:44:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	while installing the latest updates it installed the latest kernel it asked me that i dont have menu.lst do i want to generate then i said yes
2011-02-05T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	why did you say yes to that ?
2011-02-05T19:44:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i thought that menu.lst is imp file i should have it?
2011-02-05T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	no, you're using grub2  aren't you ?
2011-02-05T19:45:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes grub2
2011-02-05T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	ok, so that doesn't use menu.lst
2011-02-05T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	do you have /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2011-02-05T19:46:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yes
2011-02-05T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	ok, so if you look in there, does that match the menu you see on your grub boot screne ?
2011-02-05T19:47:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	nope. because in menu.lst it is showing right kernels that is .29 first and then .28. but in real i see .28 and then .27 in grub menu screen
2011-02-05T19:50:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	llutz how to clear this mess? i just wanted to coonfirm that this mess occured due to my saying yes to that create menu.lst?
2011-02-05T19:53:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	no you are not missing anything. i told you everything. this time i take care to use only synaptic to do this.
2011-02-05T19:56:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	not sure what's causing that behviour, never seen it before, never seen grub2 offer to generate a menu.lst either
2011-02-05T19:57:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	ok. then should i try reinstalling grrub and then new kernel?
2011-02-05T19:57:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	or instead ask on forums?
2011-02-05T19:57:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	I don't think so, I wouldn't re-install unless I had reason to believe grub2 was broke, but it's your call
2011-02-05T19:58:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	llutz_ llutz ok btw thanks your for time.i first ask on forum now
2011-02-05T19:58:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	very odd behaviour from grub
2011-02-05T19:58:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yeah
2011-02-05T20:02:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	llutz_ mkanyicy i just chekced synaptic for insatlling grub and i found that grub2 is not installed at all. there is only old grub installed. i think grub2 got remjoved while i was removing old kerrnel
2011-02-05T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	intersting, then menu.lst should be used, but you say that is different to what you see on screen
2011-02-05T20:03:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	llutz_ yeah now i am removing old grub and now installing grub2
2011-02-05T20:08:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	do tell
2011-02-05T20:09:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	llutz_ now i have the latest kernel .29 and .28 and i wanted to remove the .28. so please tell me whats the safest thing to remove from syaptic? there are two things generic,image i think
2011-02-05T20:13:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	i told installing grub2 and removing old gurb solved my problem. now i wanted to know the safe way to remove old kernel. which thing to remove ? generic or image?
2011-02-05T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	AbhiJit	synaptic is a safe way
2011-02-05T20:13:00.000Z	AbhiJit	ikonia	yeah i removed it. thanks for you all
