2007-10-23T07:20:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	i am su, i had uNmount
2007-10-23T07:03:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	lshw | less  search for  ide
2007-10-23T07:03:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	what is lshw | less?
2007-10-23T07:04:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	r u familiar with the command line or r u a gui only person
2007-10-23T07:04:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	I have done some command line stuff
2007-10-23T07:07:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	then execute  lshw |less  in a terminal window and search for  ide if you drive type is ide r u familiar with vi editor searching if so less has similar type searching when you find  ide go down a few lines and it will have the  /dev   ie.e    /dev/sdb that is your second drive then you have to manually mount it
2007-10-23T07:09:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	i am familiar with vi, although i always used nano
2007-10-23T07:10:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	since i am a long time command line person i would have no idea how to find and mount the second disk via a gui if there is a way to do such if you run into probl let me know
2007-10-23T07:10:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	then searching in less for ide will find it
2007-10-23T07:11:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	it looks like its on /dev/hda
2007-10-23T07:12:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	well, do you know if /dev/hda has more than one slice  i.e..  hda1  hda2 etc.
2007-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	was the ide drive a linux or windows drive
2007-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	its showing the ide drive as /dev/hda, and the dvd drive as /dev/hdb
2007-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	it was a linux drive
2007-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	was the whole drive used for linux
2007-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	i could no longer boot to it, so I ended up buying 2 new satas and installing ubuntu (the old one was centos)
2007-10-23T07:13:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	- yes
2007-10-23T07:14:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	then take a guess and  execute this command   mount /dev/hda1  /mnt
2007-10-23T07:15:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	let me know if the mount command suceeds
2007-10-23T07:16:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	ok i did that ..
2007-10-23T07:16:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	- yes it appears to succeed
2007-10-23T07:16:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	now do   ls  /mnt  and see if your files r there
2007-10-23T07:18:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	and i dont see it in the gui file browser
2007-10-23T07:18:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	execute  umount /mnt
2007-10-23T07:19:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	then  execute    echo 'p' | fdisk /dev/hda and tell me what prints
2007-10-23T07:20:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	its saying: unmount: command not found
2007-10-23T07:20:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	sudo umount ...
2007-10-23T07:20:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	execute  df -h and see if  /mnt is mounter
2007-10-23T07:21:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	its showing /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda2
2007-10-23T07:22:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	hda2 is Linux LVM
2007-10-23T07:22:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	what is mounted  as  /mnt
2007-10-23T07:23:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	i used umount so there is no mnt anymore
2007-10-23T07:23:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	i see that /dev/md2 is mounted as /home
2007-10-23T07:24:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	what I really need to get from this drive is a mysql database
2007-10-23T07:24:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	execute  echo 'p' | fdisk /dev/hdd
2007-10-23T07:25:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	md2  is slice 2 of your meta disk  lvm
2007-10-23T07:25:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	its saying unable to open /dev/hdd
2007-10-23T07:26:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	hold on let me check something
2007-10-23T07:27:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	when i mount something, shouldnt i be able to browse from the GUI as well?
2007-10-23T07:28:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	cant answer that as i am strictly  command line person dont use gui at all
2007-10-23T07:29:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	execute this command    lshw |grep -i  logical  |less   and see  what  /dev/hNN  devices show up  like  hda, hdb, hdc, hdd, etc.
2007-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	/dev/hda has hda1, hda2, and there's also an /dev/hdb with nothing
2007-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	pastebin  output of   lshw |grep -i logical  and let me look at it
2007-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	as /dev/hdb  is probably it
2007-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	ahh    mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
2007-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	then  ls /mnt
2007-10-23T07:37:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	it says /dev/hdb1 doesn't exist
2007-10-23T07:38:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	 pastebin  echo 'p' | fdisk /dev/hdb   and let me see what is on it
2007-10-23T07:40:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	ok 1 sec
2007-10-23T07:41:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	it says unable to open /dev/hdb

2007-10-23T07:52:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	pastebin output of   echo 'p' | fdisk /dev/hda
2007-10-23T07:53:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	i found out how to use the gui to peruse the disk once we get it mounted
2007-10-23T07:55:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	- cool.... how?
2007-10-23T07:56:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	sorry how to do what?
2007-10-23T07:57:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	the last request was to pastebin  echo 'p' | fdisk /dev/hda can you do that
2007-10-23T07:58:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	http://pastebin.com/d7e17053e
2007-10-23T07:59:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	<jtt> ChrisC36, i found out how to use the gui to peruse the disk once we get it mounted
2007-10-23T08:00:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	- oh i guess my 'how' on that was premature
2007-10-23T08:00:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	got the paste hold on
2007-10-23T08:02:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	what happens when you  execute  mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
2007-10-23T08:03:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	never mind
2007-10-23T08:03:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	execute  mount  /dev/hda1 /mnt
2007-10-23T08:04:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	looks like the device you want to mount is  /dev/hda2  and it should have the files you want
2007-10-23T08:06:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	ok - but there are not partitions showing for /dev/hda2 ?
2007-10-23T08:06:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	there is on the pastebin  you have  hda1  boot   hda2  lvm
2007-10-23T08:07:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	so I should try to mount hda2?
2007-10-23T08:07:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	yes   mount   /dev/hda2 /mnt
2007-10-23T08:09:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	i get: mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'
2007-10-23T08:10:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	yes it is a lvm file type  hold on
2007-10-23T08:13:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	execute  df -h  and tell me what comes after  /dev on the left of the line
2007-10-23T08:14:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	pick  the root  /  partition
2007-10-23T08:14:00.000Z	jtt	ChrisC36	what i am looking for is somethng  like  /dev/vg...
2007-10-23T08:15:00.000Z	ChrisC36	jtt	-ok 1 sec
