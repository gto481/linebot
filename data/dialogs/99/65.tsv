2006-06-07T07:21:00.000Z	DBO		configure, make, and checkinstall lzap
2006-06-07T07:23:00.000Z	DBO		rm -rf is not safe either....
2006-06-07T07:24:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	hey, while you're at it, I can;t get fglrx to work on my computer either -- it still uses MESA.
2006-06-07T07:25:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	how did you install?
2006-06-07T07:25:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	through apt, xorg-fglrx, stuff and the restricted modules
2006-06-07T07:26:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	did you get any errors on install?
2006-06-07T07:27:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	nope -- all fine If I remember correctly, But I don;t get the "make sure it worked" stuff
2006-06-07T07:27:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	does glxgears work?
2006-06-07T07:27:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	does xorg.conf say fglrx for driver?... if the answer to both these questions is yes, then it should be working
2006-06-07T07:27:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	Yes, but they don;t give any info concerning FPS though
2006-06-07T07:28:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	I'll check xorg.conf
2006-06-07T07:28:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	yeah, you need to do glxgears --printfps for that
2006-06-07T07:29:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	glxgears = 800 FPS
2006-06-07T07:29:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	well thats not fantastic but better than what you would get with software rendering
2006-06-07T07:31:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	my xorg: http://kubuntu.pastebin.com/765135
2006-06-07T07:32:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	it says Driver "fglrx" in there
2006-06-07T07:32:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	it might help if you enabled the fglrx driver =P
2006-06-07T07:32:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	how might I do that?
2006-06-07T07:32:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	I do and resubmit the file, and you watch =)
2006-06-07T07:33:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	http://kubuntu.pastebin.com/765140
2006-06-07T07:33:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	aaahhh -- that might do it
2006-06-07T07:33:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	I'll do that
2006-06-07T07:36:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	restarting X now, I'll see if it works
2006-06-07T07:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	Kubuntu won;t load -- I think I'll uncomment, see if the restricted mods are on and try again.
2006-06-07T07:39:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	make sure you comment out the other section
2006-06-07T07:42:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	oops -- I did not read what you said until I had finished - I did not comment out the other section, but it booted fine
2006-06-07T07:42:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	hmmm... well that answers a burning question
2006-06-07T07:42:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	what?
2006-06-07T07:46:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	the restricted modules are there
2006-06-07T07:47:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	lemme see the relevant xorg log
2006-06-07T07:47:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	which log would that be
2006-06-07T07:47:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	it will be the one in /var/log/Xorg.1.log most likely
2006-06-07T07:48:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	there's a .0. one for XPRG I'll pasetbin it (there's no .1. one)

2006-06-07T08:39:00.000Z	DBO	SeanTater	you edit the file with vi and restart kdm again
2006-06-07T08:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	DBO	okay -- well -- I've been editing it with nano over ssh anyway
