2007-11-03T19:37:00.000Z	ubuntu		Does anyone know if there is a way to download package files, save them to a usb stick, and install them on another computer later?
2007-11-03T19:41:00.000Z	ubuntu		Does anyone know if I could transfer package files downloaded with Synaptic to another Ubuntu computer, and make Synaptic use those files instead of downloading them again?
2007-11-03T19:43:00.000Z	ubuntu		Synaptic will detect them and use them?
2007-11-03T19:44:00.000Z	ubuntu		okay, thank you
2007-11-03T19:51:00.000Z	ubuntu		Can anyone tell me where Synaptic stores downloaded package files?
2007-11-04T03:50:00.000Z	ubuntu		so..this is a hardware question, kind of, i think?
2007-11-04T03:50:00.000Z	ubuntu		i can't get my graphics card out of 340*320 mode
2007-11-04T03:51:00.000Z	ubuntu		srry bout my naem as well, the widnow is too big for the screen to change it
2007-11-04T03:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		anyone?
2007-11-04T03:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		teh card is an ATI and the only one the machine will boot
2007-11-04T03:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		hence me thinking this is a hardware problem
2007-11-04T04:11:00.000Z	ubuntu		it says that i don't have any restricted drivers after  do the install
2007-11-04T04:12:00.000Z	ubuntu		um, sorry, that's out of context: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2007-11-04T04:14:00.000Z	ubuntu		sure: I have an ati card (it's the only card my compy boots with...?), well, I'm stuck in 640*320 (yes 320, not even 480)
2007-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	ubuntu		live cd at the moment, but it does the same thing with the installed version
2007-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	ubuntu		i was hoping to swap graphics cards, but it will only book with the ati one, which confuses the heck out of me
2007-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	ubuntu		it is an nvidia gforce fx 5290
2007-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	ubuntu		and the other is a generic pci vga card
2007-11-04T04:17:00.000Z	ubuntu		(sorry about the multi line things, getting use still to not doing that).  And whn I say won't boot, i mean the bios doesn't even show its information and when i put the ati card in, it says that it has had a few failed attemps (it := bios)
2007-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	ubuntu		hmm
2007-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	ubuntu		ill need to download an burn it at work tomorrow then
2007-11-04T04:19:00.000Z	ubuntu		is teh alternate (text based) install much different from other distros?
2007-11-04T04:19:00.000Z	ubuntu		ok, thank you
2007-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	ubuntu		hi, when trying to install sun-java5-plugin this is what i get: E: sun-java5-bin: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 2

2007-11-04T12:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		in restricted drivers i enable the nvidia card and it asks for reboot, but then when xubuntu starts up again the nvidia driver is still not in use
2007-11-04T12:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		i am also runing xubuntu on usb key if that makes a difference

2007-11-04T13:34:00.000Z	ubuntu		why cant i open and edit /etc/x11/xorg.conf ?
2007-11-04T16:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		hi. I'm installing ubuntu on fake raid and all went fine except for the boot loader installation phase. I already have grub installed so it's not a problem. is there other steps after the grub installation?
2007-11-04T17:01:00.000Z	ubuntu		when installing ubuntu, what comes after the grub installation?
2007-11-04T17:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	IndyGunFreak	I hope so. it seems a failure in the grub installation is fatal.
2007-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	ubuntu	IndyGunFreak	yeah I guess. but it is to the installer. but if nothing else gets done after, it's all good :)
2007-11-04T17:05:00.000Z	ubuntu		brb
2007-11-04T18:57:00.000Z	ubuntu		I already have grub installed, starting a distro. if I want to install another distro then start it through grub, all I have to do is update menu.lst on the previously installed distro's /boot/grub, right?
2007-11-04T18:59:00.000Z	ubuntu		what the hell? I try to join #debian and I'm forwarded here. what gives?
2007-11-05T01:20:00.000Z	ubuntu		:(
