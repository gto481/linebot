2007-02-18T10:24:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe		Ubuntu won't see my WLAN card, how do I get it to revert to the default install settings, since it's using the (wrong) settings from the Edgy install that it upgraded from
2007-02-18T10:24:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	whats the name of your wifi card?
2007-02-18T10:25:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	it's a Broadcom card, Airforce One
2007-02-18T10:25:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	BCM4318
2007-02-18T10:26:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	the Feisty Herd 4 live CD can see the interface, but doesn't like my WEP password. But, the GUI installer is broken, so I downloaded the alternate install CD, and followed the upgrade process. Unfortunately, Edgy never saw that as an interface, and Feisty took over Edgy's preferences, so I'm wondering what the fastest way I can revert ALL settings is
2007-02-18T10:26:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	look what do you have under /lib/firmware/`uname -r`/bcm*
2007-02-18T10:27:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	2.6.17-10-powerpc, 2.6.20-8-powerpc, and a bunch of bcm43xx firmware files
2007-02-18T10:28:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	lsmod| grep bcm  whats the result?
2007-02-18T10:28:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	nothing for BCM, because that's what the program to extract the firmware is called, but I do have a Broadcom card, BCM4318 chipset
2007-02-18T10:29:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	AirForce One 54g
2007-02-18T10:29:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	am confused, what is your answer on that lsmod ?
2007-02-18T10:29:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I have a Broadcom BCM4318 wireless card
2007-02-18T10:30:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	once more, give me the result of lsmod|grep bcm
2007-02-18T10:31:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	one sec, nuts to typing this manually
2007-02-18T10:31:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	0001:10:11.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g]  802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
2007-02-18T10:32:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	am expecting like bmc_ ????   as the answer for drivers loaded.
2007-02-18T10:32:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	oh, sorry, half asleep
2007-02-18T10:32:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	nada
2007-02-18T10:33:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	then your driver is not loaded for bcm*
2007-02-18T10:33:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	well how do I load it?
2007-02-18T10:33:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	what is in /lib/firmware/`uname -r`/bcm*/default
2007-02-18T10:34:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	nothing
2007-02-18T10:34:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	because there is *no* folder bcm
2007-02-18T10:34:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	there are just a bunch of bcm_43xx.fw files
2007-02-18T10:35:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	whats in your /etc/modprobe.d/options  file anything resembles bcm ?
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	there should be one directory under /lib/firmware/`uname -r`/   what is the name?
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	no on the options
2007-02-18T10:36:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	-bash: /lib/firmware/2.6.20-8-powerpc/: is a directory
2007-02-18T10:37:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	there should be one directory under /lib/firmware/`uname -r`/   what is the name?
2007-02-18T10:37:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I already told you, 2.6.20-8-powerpc
2007-02-18T10:38:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	no other directory below that?
2007-02-18T10:38:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	acx and zd1211 are the ONLY sub directories
2007-02-18T10:38:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	you are not paying attention to my question..i cant waste my time like that
2007-02-18T10:40:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	there are two directories below /lib/firmware/2.6.20-8-powerpc/, acx, and zd1211
2007-02-18T10:41:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	now do a dmesg|grep wlan   see if your bmc* is detected
2007-02-18T10:41:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	no
2007-02-18T10:41:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	no results of your wifi card detected from dmesg ?
2007-02-18T10:41:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	no
2007-02-18T10:41:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I have no wifi card detected!
2007-02-18T10:42:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	the system doesn't see a WLAN0, or an eth1
2007-02-18T10:42:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	then you need to play with your bios so that these card can be detected
2007-02-18T10:42:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	it would just be easier if there were a command to completely reconfigure the entire OS to be like what it would've been after a fresh install
2007-02-18T10:42:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	Mac's don't *have* a BIOS
2007-02-18T10:43:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	there must be something in the mobo that detects your hardware or to activate additional ones?
2007-02-18T10:43:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I'm on a PowerBook G4. It has NO BIOS, it Has Open Firmware. The wireless card would bite Ubuntu in the face if it could
2007-02-18T10:43:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	this card is NOT new, it's been on the computer since I got it, Ubuntu is just too stupid to detect it properly
2007-02-18T10:44:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	i bit more that i can chew..im not familiar with Mac's  :)
2007-02-18T10:45:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	what shows up if you do an ls -la /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf
2007-02-18T10:46:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	all, default, eth0, and lo
2007-04-15T07:50:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	when you compiled the kernel, did you update the links? maybe those are part of the make targets
2007-04-15T07:51:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I configured it, made the modules, and
2007-04-15T07:52:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	isnt there like an extra step of making sure initrd is also prepared?
2007-04-15T07:52:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	mkinitrd?
2007-04-15T07:52:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	perhaps, i dont recall the exact command
2007-04-15T07:53:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	make install just told me to add /boot/linux-2.6.17.14-ubuntu1 to my grub/menu.lst, so I did, and it created an initrd
2007-04-15T07:53:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	however, the initrd it created is not the same file type as the ones that apt installs
2007-04-15T07:53:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	okay, so its probably part ot that make install target
2007-04-15T07:54:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	whenever I build an initrd, I get a weird file type
2007-04-15T07:54:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	am grasping here...how do you know that the apt installs are not same type as the ones you created from make install (mkinitrd) ?
2007-04-15T07:55:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	initrd.img-2.6.17.14-ubuntu1-amd64-k8: gzip compressed data, from Unix, max compression
2007-04-15T07:55:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	that's an initrd that apt installed
2007-04-15T07:55:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	hang on, let me look at mine, just for comparison
2007-04-15T07:55:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	and here is the one that mkinitrd made: Linux Compressed ROM File System data, little endian size 5795840 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0x17278aa7, edition 0, 4472 blocks, 360 files
2007-04-15T07:56:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I've installed kernels on other distros, and I've never had this problem before
2007-04-15T07:56:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I've even followed a Ubuntu Kernel-Compilation How-To, and those instructions didn't work either
2007-04-15T07:56:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	doesnt it normally reside at /boot/  ?
2007-04-15T07:56:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	that's where it is
2007-04-15T07:57:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	hang on, let me look at some of my notes..
2007-04-15T07:57:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	ok
2007-04-15T07:59:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	sorry cant find my notes on that..
2007-04-15T07:59:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	it's ok
2007-04-15T08:00:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I left the FS types alone in the config, because I've been burned by taking some out before, on previous systems, but I assumed devfs has to be supported by defaults
2007-04-15T08:02:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	you can check the current installed configure file its in /boot/ too  config-2.6.x-386 something, if it has the FS you needed
2007-04-15T08:03:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	what am I looking for? cat /boot/config-2.6.17.14-ubuntu1 | grep devfs
2007-04-15T08:03:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	yes thats the one
2007-04-15T08:03:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	'config-2.6.17.14-ubuntu1 | grep devfs' returns nothing
2007-04-15T08:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	sorry, make that 'cat config-2.6.17.14-ubuntu1 | grep devfs'
2007-04-15T08:04:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	or basically i do   grep devfs  config-*
2007-04-15T08:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	nope
2007-04-15T08:05:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	that indicates that the current installed one does not support devfs?
2007-04-15T08:05:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	it won't boot
2007-04-15T08:05:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	the kernel panics
2007-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	It decompresses the image, and I get a bunch of stuff about how it can't find /lib/modules/$version/modules.dep and how DEVFS is not mounted
2007-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	i forget the steps to revert back to the working kernel..umm..
2007-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I'm on a working kernel
2007-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	well, hardly working
2007-04-15T08:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	this kernel is dying, and it's not a pretty death
2007-04-15T08:07:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	as long as you saved your important data on separate partition, you can fiddle with the kernel as much..
2007-04-15T08:07:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	my home directory is on another partition
2007-04-15T08:08:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	you are okay then, keep hacking at it.. :)
2007-04-15T08:08:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I experience multiple kernel panics/day on this kernel, so it is necessary that I migrate off it
2007-04-15T08:08:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	yes, but I've run out of things to do. I've followed a Ubuntu Kernel install How-To, and that didn't produce a booting kernel
2007-04-15T08:09:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	i actually have not done ubuntu or debian like kernels, i would assume its not too different from others that are rpm based
2007-04-15T08:09:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I've tried everything I know how to do to get this 2.6.17.14-ubuntu1 kernel to boot, and still nothing
2007-04-15T08:09:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	I've installed many kernels on Mandrake and RedHat systems, I've checked my notes, followed them too, nothing works
2007-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	let me look around for that article i read about something it uses utf-8 vs 8559 ..let me see if thats the cause of your issues
2007-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	thanks
2007-04-15T08:13:00.000Z	bulmer	Ice_Wewe	i have to log off, my bookmarks are corrupted, i did an update last night and have not rebooted yet..
2007-04-15T08:13:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	bulmer	ok, bye
