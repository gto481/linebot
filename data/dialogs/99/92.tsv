2005-01-06T17:59:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	when you installed the deb were there any error messages?
2005-01-06T17:59:00.000Z	techn9ne		yes it was complaining i didnt have lpd

2005-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	and when you installed it?
2005-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	techn9ne		thats what it said...
2005-01-06T06:00:00.000Z	housetier		did you get error messages then too?
2005-01-06T06:01:00.000Z	techn9ne		yes i just pasted it
2005-01-06T06:01:00.000Z	housetier		postrm hints at removal attempt though
2005-01-06T06:02:00.000Z	techn9ne		can i open up the .deb file in archiver view the config files find out what it installed remove manually and force to rebuild deb db?
2005-01-06T06:03:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	what you can do is edit that postrm script so it will exit successfully
2005-01-06T06:04:00.000Z	housetier		leave the !#/bin/whatever stuff on the first line and insert "exit 0" on the second line
2005-01-06T06:04:00.000Z	techn9ne		it wants lpd is that a alternative to cups?
2005-01-06T06:04:00.000Z	housetier		you will have to remove the files by hand then
2005-01-06T06:04:00.000Z	techn9ne		thats sure a pain
2005-01-06T06:05:00.000Z	housetier		not really
2005-01-06T06:05:00.000Z	housetier		you can find out which files belong to the .deb and remove them
2005-01-06T06:05:00.000Z	techn9ne		what format is .deb in tar gz?
2005-01-06T06:06:00.000Z	housetier		its .ar
2005-01-06T06:06:00.000Z	techn9ne		do i have to get osmething to open it?
2005-01-06T06:06:00.000Z	housetier		if you have midnight commander installed, you can browse it
2005-01-06T06:06:00.000Z	techn9ne		whats midnight commander?
2005-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	housetier		a very good console based file manager
2005-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	housetier		looks like the old norton commander for dos
2005-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	techn9ne		where can i get it?
2005-01-06T06:08:00.000Z	housetier		first you edit the script, so apt-get et al can work again
2005-01-06T06:08:00.000Z	techn9ne		... i cant open the deb
2005-01-06T06:08:00.000Z	housetier		then you install it so you can remove those files
2005-01-06T06:08:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	/var/lib/dpkg/info/mfc4800lpr.postrm
2005-01-06T06:11:00.000Z	housetier		have /usr/bin/firefox as login shell or so?
2005-01-06T06:11:00.000Z	techn9ne		k i edied the file... ran /var/lib/dpkg/info/mfc4800lpr.postrm
2005-01-06T06:11:00.000Z	techn9ne		i tried uninstalling again didnt work
2005-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	ok whats the error message?
2005-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	techn9ne		same
2005-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	techn9ne		inconsistent state
2005-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	techn9ne		reinstall
2005-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	btw I hope this will teach you to blindly install .deb packages from "untrusted" sources ;)
2005-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	techn9ne		well it came from brother.com
2005-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	techn9ne		http://solutions.brother.com/Library/sol/printer/linux/lpr_drivers.html
2005-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	well have you tried to reinstall it as suggested?
2005-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	techn9ne		yes
2005-01-06T06:14:00.000Z	techn9ne		its just complainintg because i dont have lpd
2005-01-06T06:14:00.000Z	techn9ne		does ubuntu have lpd?
2005-01-06T06:15:00.000Z	housetier		it should depend on lpd which it doesn't
2005-01-06T06:15:00.000Z	housetier		it doesn't depend on anything
2005-01-06T06:18:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	if you are willing we could try to fix the package database by hand
2005-01-06T06:18:00.000Z	techn9ne		sure
2005-01-06T06:18:00.000Z	housetier		but we might not be successful as I haven't done it before
2005-01-06T06:18:00.000Z	techn9ne		if we break it we break it i have no option left after this but a clean install of ubuntu
2005-01-06T06:18:00.000Z	housetier		nah we won't break it
2005-01-06T06:19:00.000Z	housetier		we will make backups :D
2005-01-06T06:19:00.000Z	techn9ne		ok
2005-01-06T06:19:00.000Z	housetier		you downloaded this deb here: http://solutions.brother.com/Library/sol/printer/linux/rpmfiles/lpr_debian/mfc4800lpr-1.1.2-1.i386.deb ?
2005-01-06T06:19:00.000Z	techn9ne		yes
2005-01-06T06:20:00.000Z	housetier		ok lets start with the easy part: removing the files
2005-01-06T06:21:00.000Z	housetier		/usr/bin/brprintconf, /usr/lib/libbrcomplpr.so, /usr/local/Brother/*
2005-01-06T06:22:00.000Z	techn9ne		k done
2005-01-06T06:23:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	ok next one is easy too then it will become more delicat quickly, "cd /var/lib/dpkg"
2005-01-06T06:24:00.000Z	techn9ne		k
2005-01-06T06:25:00.000Z	housetier		there are four files which we might need to touch so we will make backups now: available, available-old, status, status-old
2005-01-06T06:25:00.000Z	housetier		just cp them to your home dir or so
2005-01-06T06:26:00.000Z	techn9ne		k
2005-01-06T06:27:00.000Z	housetier		well here comes the experiment...
2005-01-06T06:27:00.000Z	housetier		available is a very large file, open it in your favorite text editor
2005-01-06T06:28:00.000Z	housetier		then search for mfc4800lpr
2005-01-06T06:28:00.000Z	techn9ne		open which file?
2005-01-06T06:29:00.000Z	housetier		"available"
2005-01-06T06:30:00.000Z	techn9ne		k i delete that block of text?
2005-01-06T06:30:00.000Z	housetier		only the mfc4800 part, yes :)
2005-01-06T06:31:00.000Z	techn9ne		k done
2005-01-06T06:31:00.000Z	housetier		save and repeat for "available-old", "status", and "status-old"
2005-01-06T06:33:00.000Z	techn9ne		k
2005-01-06T06:33:00.000Z	housetier		no check the status with "dpkg -l mfc4800lpr"
2005-01-06T06:34:00.000Z	techn9ne		no packages found. cool thanks.
2005-01-06T06:34:00.000Z	housetier		ok yet another check: "dpkg --audit"
2005-01-06T06:35:00.000Z	housetier		moin
2005-01-06T06:36:00.000Z	techn9ne		returned nothing
2005-01-06T06:36:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	it seems the package database is fixed now :)
2005-01-06T06:36:00.000Z	techn9ne	housetier	: thanks you rock
2005-01-06T06:36:00.000Z	techn9ne		nowq i just gotta figure out how to get the printer working w/o those drivers
2005-01-06T06:37:00.000Z	housetier		my dpkg-fu is strong
2005-01-06T06:37:00.000Z	housetier		;)
2005-01-06T06:38:00.000Z	techn9ne		thats pretty easy compared to fixing windowws registry problems
2005-01-06T06:38:00.000Z	techn9ne		you can never giure out what the installer did
2005-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	techn9ne		free?
2005-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	techn9ne		not w/ the MPAA and RIAA shutting down bit torrent
2005-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	techn9ne		i think they want to shut down the technology
2005-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	housetier		xlib-dev?
2005-01-06T06:46:00.000Z	housetier	techn9ne	you could try and see if CUPS has support for your printer
2005-01-06T06:48:00.000Z	techn9ne	housetier	: i got it using a similar modeled printer
