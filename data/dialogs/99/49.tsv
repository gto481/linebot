2007-08-25T11:17:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	i don't have one but what's the problem you are having
2007-08-25T11:18:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 my mic is not working properly
2007-08-25T11:18:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 I try cranking up the mic voule and the sound becomes garbled
2007-08-25T11:19:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 any clue?
2007-08-25T11:19:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	hmm
2007-08-25T11:20:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 this little glitch is no very common
2007-08-25T11:20:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	anything that could be causeing noise like a power cable near the mic cable
2007-08-25T11:21:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	(I doubt it's you sound card)
2007-08-25T11:21:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 not quite... it is a head set.. brand new,,
2007-08-25T11:22:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 could it be the sound capture device?
2007-08-25T11:22:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 there are many options if I click the drop down box
2007-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	i'd rather start with the simple options.
2007-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	actually thats a good idea
2007-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 well... I shall fiddle and see
2007-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	what's in the box right now?
2007-08-25T11:24:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	what's in the box right now?
2007-08-25T11:26:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Arquitecture
2007-08-25T11:27:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 trying diferent stuff didn't work
2007-08-25T11:28:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	is the mic jack in the mic port and not the line in?
2007-08-25T11:29:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 it is pretty hard to miss it ... it is a laptop ;)
2007-08-25T11:30:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	is the headset wireless or wired
2007-08-25T11:30:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 wired
2007-08-25T11:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	describe again what happens if you turn the sound all the way up
2007-08-25T11:32:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 well ... the audio of any song or movie becomes garbled .. with lot's of static... and
2007-08-25T11:32:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 it doesn't get any input from the mic
2007-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 i'm guessing there is something wrong with alsa
2007-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	 ...it's not the mic?
2007-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Ashfire908	 bough it brand new... it is a headset
2007-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	is it the mic?

2007-08-25T11:35:00.000Z	Ashfire908	effie_jayx	is it the mic?
