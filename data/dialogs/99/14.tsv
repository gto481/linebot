2010-04-06T11:19:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Shuttleworth is the leader of Ubuntu project... But come on. Ubuntu won't screw you... more likely windows will
2010-04-06T11:20:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Meh, it's not that noticable except for the full circle and the name
2010-04-06T11:21:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Try out Linux Mint. It's Ubuntu-based but has nothing to do with that stuff.
2010-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Ever heard of the tab key?
2010-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Type first few letters of the nickname and hit TAB, it will insert the full nickname. Like this: foxm + tab = foxmulder881

2010-04-06T22:45:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Media buttons...?!
2010-04-06T22:45:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	 Do these problems arise from upgrading versions through the software update or is this abnormal
2010-04-06T22:46:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Updates tend to break stuff sometimes. But it's usually not that major.
2010-04-06T22:46:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	 yeah like laptops have "play , stop , next song " and stuff, mine all work but the volume control ones don't work properly anymore
2010-04-06T22:46:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	 it is major though cus these things are pretty important so how can I fix them?
2010-04-06T22:46:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	 why do updates break things anyways? Can it be fixed?
2010-04-06T22:47:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Hah, that. Don't worry, volume stuffs are broken on Jaunty for me too, known problem. Karmic has them working :/

2010-04-06T22:47:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	As per that. Hm... Do you get any sounds at all?
2010-04-06T22:48:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	 yeah sound is working and the sound theme plays normally when I sample play the sounds
2010-04-06T22:48:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Okay, then a few checks, does "System -> Preferences -> Startup apps" contain "GNOME Login Sounds"?
2010-04-06T22:50:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	no it doesn't
2010-04-06T22:50:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	There is the problem. Click on "add", and put anything as name/comment and the following as "Command": /usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play --id="desktop-login" --description="GNOME Login"

2010-04-21T09:50:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	Lol then you must install firefox-3.5-branding package
2010-04-21T09:52:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	well, try this first to tell if branding is installed: dpkg -l | grep 'firefox-3.5-branding'

2010-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	it responds with information on the package, so i guess its installed
2010-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	I assume it has "ii" there right

2010-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	The icon file is /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox-3.5.png

2011-10-02T14:51:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	You have to create it
2011-10-02T14:51:00.000Z	RP64	theadmin	Seriously? But wouldn't you have to download it  how would I create it it has to have something in it right
2011-10-02T14:53:00.000Z	theadmin	RP64	xorg.conf is honestly no longer required. The missing sections are auto-configured. If all sections are missing (i.e. file is empty or doesn't exist), it autoconfigures, well, everything
