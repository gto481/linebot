2010-07-27T22:30:00.000Z	milen8204		How i can change my mac address ?
2010-07-27T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	milen8204	I know how in /etc/network/interfaces
2010-07-27T22:31:00.000Z	milen8204	ActionParsnip	i tried but i couldn`t wria any word there
2010-07-27T22:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	milen8204	not sure if it will stop network manager being able to manage the interface thoough
2010-07-27T22:32:00.000Z	milen8204	ActionParsnip	I must cut out all connections

2010-07-27T22:32:00.000Z	milen8204	ActionParsnip	thanks
2010-07-27T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	milen8204	you can use the interfaces to set a static ip. If you want to change your internet ip (ie. You don't use a router) then you will need to contact your provider
2010-07-27T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	milen8204	you can change what ip you have on your own lan very freely as long as it falls into the subnet of your router (you can even change that if you want to change all of the address) but the ip you get from your provider is given to you and is out of your control
2010-07-27T22:37:00.000Z	milen8204	ActionParsnip	I have changed my PC and my old PC had had a difren IP and MAC than new one :D
2010-07-27T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	milen8204	that's normal. Here is how you can define ip in the interfaces file too. If you use it then network manager will NOT be able to manage the interface http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
2010-07-27T22:38:00.000Z	milen8204	ActionParsnip	thanks a lot
