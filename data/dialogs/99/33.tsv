2008-04-18T05:24:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	well ... is it an onboard soundcard? is it one that's in a PCI slot?
2008-04-18T05:24:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	its onboard
2008-04-18T05:25:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	laptop or desktop computer?
2008-04-18T05:25:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	if you mean do i have a sound card... its part of my motherboard

2008-04-18T05:26:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	hmm ... okay, a wild guess would be you have a nforce onboard soundcard
2008-04-18T05:26:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	... which sadly means it SHOULD work out of the box
2008-04-18T05:26:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	you don't have ANY sound at all?

2008-04-18T05:38:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	and it has the green port
2008-04-18T05:38:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	pretty sure it has one
2008-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	It just looks like Ubuntu didn't recognize it at all somehow
2008-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	damnit! any way?
2008-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	one sec ... thinking and trying something out
2008-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	thanks. your the best guy
2008-04-18T05:40:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	nope ... if I was the best I'd already have solved your problem ;)
2008-04-18T05:42:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	on an off chance, you might try to reinstall the nvidia-kernel in synaptic
2008-04-18T05:42:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	how to do it?
2008-04-18T05:43:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	open synaptic (system->Administration->synaptic) and search for nvidia-kernel
2008-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	theres 2
2008-04-18T05:44:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	common and source. common is check
2008-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	ok i reinstall common
2008-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	sigh ... it's already installed, but well ... can't hurt : rightclick on it, and select "Mark for reinstallation"
2008-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	lol ... was going to say that ;)
2008-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	ok. nothing left to do?
2008-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	check that pulseaudio is installed too
2008-04-18T05:47:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	but if it appears in the list, it is
2008-04-18T05:47:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio
2008-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	try the sound panel again
2008-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	nothing
2008-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	BLEH!
2008-04-18T05:49:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	:(
2008-04-18T05:49:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	maybe someway to find out what mothercard i have? and then install the drivers for audio?
2008-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	the nvidia kernel should take care of that ...
2008-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	of course, if you're really unlucky, you have a creative labs xfi onboard
2008-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	let's try something else
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	in a console, type "pulseaudio --check"
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	sammyF_	wooting	just in caseyou don't know : you can autocomplete lines by pressing TAB once in a console
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	wooting	sammyF_	i know. ok i did it. nothing output
