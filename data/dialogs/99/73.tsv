2006-05-27T15:27:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	you don't
2006-05-27T15:27:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	its a horrible idea, not safe, insecure
2006-05-27T15:30:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	man mount is the documentation for the mount program
2006-05-27T15:31:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	run this: "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab"
2006-05-27T15:31:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	tell me when it opens
2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	it probably doesn't like you
2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	did you change something or has it never worked?
2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	thats probably why
2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	if you feel comfortable ediitng your lilo.conf, you need to pass a boot option of 'splash' I believe
2006-06-07T15:12:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	please don't paste
2006-06-07T15:13:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	have you been messing with your sources.list?
2006-06-07T15:13:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	thats a dapper kernel
2006-06-07T15:15:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	no yours is fine
2006-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	just install linux-k7
2006-06-07T15:17:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	thats only on dapper
2006-06-07T15:18:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	on breezy the most recent kernel is 2.6.12-10
2006-06-07T15:19:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	4 hours for what?
2006-06-07T15:19:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	I don't know
2006-06-07T15:19:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	ah
2006-06-07T15:25:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	have you run through sound troubleshooting section in the wiki?
2006-06-08T14:40:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	oss is on by default
2006-06-12T08:18:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	you've been told countless times not to paste
2006-06-16T10:14:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	from the page "They don't work with kernel 2.6"
2006-06-16T10:14:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	== they don't work with Ubuntu
2006-06-19T08:42:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	what program is giving the error about the kernel version?
2006-06-19T08:38:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	I think I've personally told you to not paste about 10 times now, how many times before you actually listen?
2006-06-19T08:38:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	use it the *first* time, not after you get yelled at
2006-06-19T08:39:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	to fix that error just install the latest version of linux-headers
2006-06-19T08:40:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	do you have the version that matches your running kernel?
2006-06-19T08:41:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`'
2006-06-19T08:45:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	^^
2006-06-19T15:53:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	you mean a really crappy player?
2006-06-19T15:53:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	totem?
2006-06-19T15:53:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	did you install totem-xine?
2006-06-19T15:54:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	mplayer is good player
2006-06-19T15:55:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	you might have to write one
2006-06-19T15:55:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	vlc is the only other thing I can think of
2006-06-19T15:57:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	I use Kaffeine but you'll have to pull down all the KDE libs
2006-06-19T15:58:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	it depends on how you define a player, mplayer will play 10x the media files WMP does
2006-06-19T15:59:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	^^^
2006-06-20T16:01:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	I think we've listed pretty much every player, so if you aren't satisified, fire up a a web browser and start googling and/or fire up a text editor and start helping make totem better
2006-06-20T16:06:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	good for music, doesn't do video
2006-06-20T16:06:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	try kaffeine
2006-06-20T16:06:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	I believe it does play WMA files because it uses the xine engine
2006-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	people with DVD isos
2006-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	what if I don't want to delete it?

2006-06-20T10:44:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	the point is Fat32 sucks :-)
2006-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	the point is to have *2* copies of it
2006-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	windows can read ext3
2006-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	^^^

2006-06-20T11:36:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	go to the terminal and run 'env | grep -i proxy'
2006-06-20T11:38:00.000Z	NoUse	Some_Person	did you run the 'env...' command?
