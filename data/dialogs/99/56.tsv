2006-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	yoshig3	that makes me think your card either card is dieing or just the memory is not working properly
2006-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	it's a brand new card and worked perfect in windows

2006-12-12T17:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	yoshig3	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and make sure everything is right if not change it and add the memory when asked what the mem of card is
2006-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	it's asking me what driver to use, it says vesa atm...but that can't be right, must just be the default list item. Should I use nVidia or nv?
2006-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	yoshig3	make sure BUSID is right also
2006-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	yeah, it's about to ask for busid. Should I just lspci and check it?
2006-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	yoshig3	what busid does lspci say you might have to change it a bit

2006-12-12T17:53:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	make the busid 01:00:00 ?
2006-12-12T17:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	yoshig3	its ok not worried about it saying vga since they all say that that i have seen
2006-12-12T17:54:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	but it says 01:00.0 in lspci

2006-12-12T17:59:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	It's saying " Users of PowerPC machines, and users of any computer with multiple video....."
2006-12-12T06:00:00.000Z	yoshig3	gnomefreak	and it has the <Ok>, but I can't continue, no matter how many times I press enter.
