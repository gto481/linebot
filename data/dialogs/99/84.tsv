2005-08-03T12:06:00.000Z	nelsongs		couldn't see anything when i installed ubuntu on my laptop

2005-08-03T12:07:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 i have an hp dv4000 notebook
2005-08-03T12:07:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 intel 915GMhipset
2005-08-03T12:07:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	hm.. when did you see nothing? after you installed ?
2005-08-03T12:07:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 i can't see anything
2005-08-03T12:07:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 though i can hear the drums
2005-08-03T12:08:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	could you see the installation process?
2005-08-03T12:08:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	yes.  and it went well
2005-08-03T12:08:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	ok, then I fully understand, I think the default resolution is too high for your laptop screen
2005-08-03T12:09:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	can you boot up your laptop, so we might be able to fix it?
2005-08-03T12:09:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 actually, i'm using the console
2005-08-03T12:09:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	ah you found the console, nice nice nice
2005-08-03T12:09:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 well, not in this irc
2005-08-03T12:09:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 but beside me.  heheh
2005-08-03T12:10:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	Ok, lets open the X.org configuration - it's located in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf - you can open it by typing nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf - If you didn't knew already
2005-08-03T12:10:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 okay, i opened it
2005-08-03T12:11:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	good, press ctrl+w
2005-08-03T12:11:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	typ: modes, and hit enter - repeat this twice
2005-08-03T12:12:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	okay, what's next?
2005-08-03T12:12:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	have you got your cursor near Modes now?
2005-08-03T12:13:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 yeah
2005-08-03T12:13:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	section screen, right?
2005-08-03T12:13:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	wee, alright do you know some laptop screen specifications of yours?
2005-08-03T12:13:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 it's a widescreen 15.4"
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	Ok, so the maximum resolution should be 1024x786 or 800x600 right?
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 hp brightview.  well, when windows was installed here, it was just a plug and play monitor
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	same here, just a resolution ;)
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 oh okay  :D
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	in that section screen, what is the default Dept?
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 24
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	change that to 16
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 okay, next?
2005-08-03T12:16:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	go down with your cursor to SubSection "Display", where Dept 16 is located
2005-08-03T12:16:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 okay
2005-08-03T12:17:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	now, replace that Modes line with this mode line: Modes<tab>"640x480" "800x600"
2005-08-03T12:18:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 just two modes?   so i have to delete the 1024x768 mode?
2005-08-03T12:19:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	just two modes, if there are more working we can always add more ;-)
2005-08-03T12:19:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	oh i see, so the highest resolution would be 800x600 if it works?
2005-08-03T12:19:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	yes indeed
2005-08-03T12:19:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 okay, so what's next?
2005-08-03T12:20:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	exit the editor by pressing ctrl+x, don't forget to save it
2005-08-03T12:20:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 okay, so, what's next?  reboot?
2005-08-03T12:20:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	No!!
2005-08-03T12:20:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	in linux you never would have to reboot  :D
2005-08-03T12:21:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 okay, hehe.  don't worry, i'm still waiting for you
2005-08-03T12:21:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	are you logged in as a normal user?
2005-08-03T12:21:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 yeah, but used sudo to edit xorg.conf
2005-08-03T12:21:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	okay, great - start the graphical X server we just edited with 'startx'
2005-08-03T12:22:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 but it has been started.  i just used the ctrl-alt-f key to use the console
2005-08-03T12:23:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	so.. it already worked :-
2005-08-03T12:23:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 forgot, how do i exit from this console?
2005-08-03T12:24:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	press the following buttons ctrl+alt+backspace
2005-08-03T12:25:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 startx error, couldn't start because there's one running already
2005-08-03T12:25:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	shutdown the current one by pressing ctrl+alt+backspace
2005-08-03T12:27:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 didn't work
2005-08-03T12:27:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	what happend after you pressed the buttons?
2005-08-03T12:28:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	nothing, displays the console for 1 sec, then no display
2005-08-03T12:28:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 same as before we started
2005-08-03T12:30:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 still the same  :(
2005-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	what do you see then? you can see a terminal you just said :-/
2005-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 yup  just the terminal for about a sec, then blank
2005-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 then heard the drums again
2005-08-03T12:33:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	oh.. I wish I could help you further, but I have to go now :-( - Hope someone else can help you further
2005-08-06T14:34:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	hey wb :-)

2005-08-06T14:34:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 do you have any idea on the TI media card reader?
2005-08-06T14:35:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	hmm card readers
2005-08-06T14:35:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 aren't they supported yet?
2005-08-06T14:35:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	I think they are, i'll google some
2005-08-06T14:35:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 i have a texas instrument media card reader
2005-08-06T14:36:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	i have resolved my video, just to let you know  :)
2005-08-06T14:36:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	did you? how :-)?
2005-08-06T14:37:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	lot of steps that i couldn't even remember anymore.  **confused**
2005-08-06T14:38:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	hehe, well yea the result mathers :D
2005-08-06T14:38:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	about the TI card reader, I see more people with the problem that it's not being recounized
2005-08-06T14:40:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-25121.html
2005-08-06T14:41:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	now i'm getting frustrated again
2005-08-06T14:42:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	good thing i don't need the media card reader atm
2005-08-06T14:42:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	It's a known issue, and your not the only one that has the problem - I bet they are working on it
2005-08-06T14:43:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	i hope they are.  i actually saw one group that develops TI drivers
2005-08-06T14:43:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	and they're selling the sdk for the driver
2005-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	i tried to install it, but it's just an evaluation.
2005-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	evaluation?
2005-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	no proper documentation on how to activate the drivers
2005-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	is it a tar package?
2005-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	yeah, coz they're selling the sdk
2005-08-06T14:45:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	and you can generate and compile the drivers thru their sdk, but won't let you use it
2005-08-06T14:45:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	blah that's kinda useless :-(
2005-08-06T14:46:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	they have their own program to run it so that you could test it to your hardware if it works
2005-08-06T14:46:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	yeah, i know, suckers, they all are
2005-08-06T14:46:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	I agree, you might also want to ring the bell on the ubuntuforums about the Ti Cardreader
2005-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 yeah, i will
2005-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 i'll try to document the stuffs i did to my notebook, especially the video
2005-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	yes that would be nice
2005-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	 and i'll let you know, i'll just post it in my site tomorrow
2005-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	nelsongs	znh	got to go now, thanks!  see ya all later!
2005-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	znh	nelsongs	goodbye :-)
