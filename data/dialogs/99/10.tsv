2010-10-23T13:52:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	nooo
2010-10-23T13:24:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	network manager can do that, just edit the connection and click on the box that says "allow anyone to connect"
2010-10-23T13:26:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	does allowing connection to anyone means that system will acquire IP from network before system's startup password has been entered ?!
2010-10-23T13:27:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	that's how it works on my end
2010-10-23T13:28:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	the interfaces file is the old way of assigning IP's. once you do it, the easier GUI way is broken and will not work, at all, whatsoever.
2010-10-23T13:28:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	unless, of course, you restore the interfaces file to its original configuration
2010-10-23T13:29:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	so, you can either click on one box, or go through all of that hassle
2010-10-23T13:36:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	i have rebooted but the machine did not connect to network before I put in the password at starup & hit enter
2010-10-23T13:38:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	weird...
2010-10-23T13:39:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	it connected directly after i put in password & entered
2010-10-23T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	any luck?
2010-10-23T13:41:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	speaking of weird, I just noticed something odd with my system... sec
2010-10-23T13:42:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	okay, just noticed I had wicd and network-manager installed side-by-side somehow
2010-10-23T13:42:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	i have them both aswell
2010-10-23T13:43:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	cause yesterday someone told me that wicd would do the job so I installed it
2010-10-23T13:43:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	r u connected wired or wireless ?
2010-10-23T13:43:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	wireless. i just removed network-manager, only supposed to have one or the other.
2010-10-23T13:45:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	i am on wireless aswell.....but urs worked while having both u said....how did u know it system connected before u logged-in system password ?
2010-10-23T13:45:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	I have no idea
2010-10-23T13:46:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	ah so u r not sure that ur system was assigned an IP before you logged-in
2010-10-23T13:47:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	well, heh, I just logged out, switched to ctrl-alt-f1 and reattached my screen session, and I'm still on the network
2010-10-23T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	oh man... did you remove network-manager?
2010-10-23T13:52:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	ctrl-alt-f1 got me into a black screen so I had to power off
2010-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	nooooooooo!
2010-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	how do I remove network-manager ?
2010-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	never do that! ctrl-alt-f1 takes you to the first console
2010-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	u told me u did so & u were still connected
2010-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	yes, because I'm using irssi in screen
2010-10-23T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	you can get back to the GUI by pressing alt-f7 or alt-f8
2010-10-23T13:54:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	ofcourse i dont know what irssi is :)
2010-10-23T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	lol
2010-10-23T13:54:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	how do I remove network-manager ?
2010-10-23T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	you're sure you have wicd installed?
2010-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	sudo apt-get remove network-manager
2010-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	yes
2010-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	after that, make sure that wicd is handling the connection properly
2010-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	i have both icons on top
2010-10-23T13:57:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	yeah, after I removed NM, its icon went away after I relogged in and the wicd icon is properly illuminated now and my connection is much more stable
2010-10-23T13:58:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	removed network manager
2010-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	will restart & see if wicd now gets connected before log-in password is entered
2010-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	okay
2010-10-23T14:03:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	frustrating
2010-10-23T14:03:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	yeah, you'll need an X display somewhere
2010-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	i restarted....then got the password small window.....at that time my pc was not connected to the network yet
2010-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	it only connected after i put in the password & ofcourse hit enter
2010-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	what's X display ?
2010-10-23T14:05:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	uh, that was meant for acidflash, not you
2010-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	is there any special settings needed on wicd ?
2010-10-23T14:07:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	it ought to just work
2010-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	just trying to figure out how u knew ur pc was connected to the network & acquired IP before u entered the startup log-in & password
2010-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	it only asks for the password once
2010-10-23T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	as i said, i switched to the console, logged in and checked the IP information
2010-10-23T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	afterward, i switched back to the GUI
2010-10-23T14:09:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	u switched to the console before putting in the password on system startup ?
2010-10-23T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	of course
2010-10-23T14:10:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	well, i just logged out
2010-10-23T14:10:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	i didn't reboot the system, that would be silly
2010-10-23T14:10:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	no that's not the log out i am talking about ofcourse
2010-10-23T14:10:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	but that makes no sense, it doesn't need to be connected before I login for the first time
2010-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	i am talking about a Desktop that would power off if the electricity gets cut off & then it powers on when the electricity gets back....so what I need is that the system gets connected before the log-in password has been entered
2010-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	that's what servers are for
2010-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	so that when I log on to it remotely I can see the log-in screen & put in the password myself
2010-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	well wicd should do that anyway, I don't see why it's not
2010-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	otherwise I have to remove the password option & that way the system will be have a security hole
2010-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	that is even more silly. why not just have your account login automatically on bootup and have it set a screensaver/lock right away?
2010-10-23T14:15:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	it is a good idea.....how do I make it ?
2010-10-23T14:16:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	you set it up with the login manager, system->administration->login screen
2010-10-23T14:19:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	do I set it to 1 sec ?
2010-10-23T14:19:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	sure
2010-10-23T14:20:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	will test
2010-10-23T14:27:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	nice option.....set it to 600 secs....which is the max
2010-10-23T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	huh?
2010-10-23T14:28:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	so no one can log-in after me for 600 secs
2010-10-23T14:29:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	but there is no option of setting screensaver to work immediately after log-in....the minimum is 1 minute
2010-10-23T14:29:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	so let it go 1 minute. what's the chance someone else will be there?
2010-10-23T14:30:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	yeah right.....now my development phase is complete....I am ready to move this implementation to a new machine
2010-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	ok
2010-12-14T11:10:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	sudo /etc/init.d/logwatch start
2010-12-14T11:11:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	command not found
2010-12-14T11:12:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	try installing it first
2010-12-14T11:14:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	I have it already & it sends me a daily report on my email but suddenly the past 3 days it started to send me some srambled lines with 'Can't exec "/bin/sh": Argument list too long at /usr/sbin/logwatch line 862'
2010-12-14T11:15:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	aah, did you check the files that it reads from? possibly in /var?
2010-12-14T11:19:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	the logs are fine
2010-12-14T11:20:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	none of them seem overbloated?
2010-12-14T11:21:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	I dont know.....they seem like that last time I have seen them
2010-12-14T11:23:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	well it's a shell script, right?
2010-12-14T11:24:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	I found an error on fail2ban.log
2010-12-14T11:24:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	oh?
2010-12-14T11:29:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	that's line 82 on usr/sbin/logwatch :           system("$Config{'pathtocat'} $Command") == 0
2010-12-14T11:30:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	not sure why that makes a difference, maybe turn debugging on and run it again
2010-12-14T11:33:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	how do I run it agin?
2010-12-14T11:34:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	just add -x to it:  #!/bin/sh -x
2010-12-14T11:35:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	I dont understand...pls simplify
2010-12-14T11:36:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	thought you said it was a shell script
2010-12-14T11:36:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	I'm not sure, read through it, see if there's a comment or something for debugging purposes... if not, dunno
2010-12-14T11:37:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	u mean debug on sshd_config
2010-12-14T11:37:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	no, I mean debug on logwatch
2010-12-14T11:39:00.000Z	anygivenname	Gnea	what's the command line to have logwatch generate report now ?
2010-12-14T11:40:00.000Z	Gnea	anygivenname	I don't know, read the manpage
