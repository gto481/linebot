2008-02-07T16:29:00.000Z	frost0		Is it okay for me to run ubuntu w/ less than a gig of storage left?
2008-02-07T16:29:00.000Z	frost0		like 850mb ?
2008-02-07T16:30:00.000Z	frost0		it's all i have :(
2008-02-07T16:30:00.000Z	frost0		not install*
2008-02-07T16:31:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	how much space is USED .. ? and what filesystem are you using?
2008-02-07T16:31:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	i've used about 18gb....and not sure which filesystem :(
2008-02-07T16:31:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	type ` mount `
2008-02-07T16:32:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	whats it say about \ ?
2008-02-07T16:32:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	command not found?
2008-02-07T16:33:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	its usually a bad idea to have less than 10-20 % free space because fragmentation increases nonlinearly as free space decreases
2008-02-07T16:34:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	i'm not planning on using anymore space....i just cleaned up....and no some apps are runing oddly :(
2008-02-07T16:34:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	what is the command to check my hd space again?
2008-02-07T16:34:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	qzio : at the same time ?

2008-02-07T16:37:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	it's actually a nice computer...just a tiny hd..
2008-02-07T16:37:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	just don't let /tmp or /var/log fill up :-0
2008-02-07T16:37:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	i did yesterday..
2008-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	it was bad...
2008-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	may that be why things were getting messed up?
2008-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	but would the damage be permanent?
2008-02-07T16:38:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	gnome-rdp says error reading database
2008-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	cant i just reinstall...i tried...but same error :(
2008-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	you might need to purge & reinstall
2008-02-07T16:39:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	howso? :)
2008-02-07T16:40:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	i'm really contemplating removing sauerbraten for space..
2008-02-07T16:41:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	never heard of it .. i'm installing it ;)
2008-02-07T16:41:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	it's sweet...but about 900mb.

2008-02-07T16:43:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	is it wise to truecrypt your hard drive?........i have nothing to hid but....it sounds cool.. ..
2008-02-07T16:43:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	reading about it on downloadsquad.com
2008-02-07T16:44:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	not unless you need to ... a surprising number of people forget their passwords ...
2008-02-07T16:44:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	whats assassin edition ?
2008-02-07T16:44:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	okay....uh....its the newest release i guess.
2008-02-07T16:44:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	its nice...
2008-02-07T16:45:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	according to sauerbraten.org
2008-02-07T16:45:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	okay the package that is giving me trouble is gnome-rdp...
2008-02-07T16:45:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	how do i purge and reinstall that?
2008-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	aptitude purge gnome-rdp; aptitude install gnome-rdp
2008-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	will this give me a menu item?
2008-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	if i don't use add/remove?
2008-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	i think so
2008-02-07T16:47:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	the gnome add/remove is just a gtk front end for aptitude / synaptic / apt / dpkg
2008-02-07T16:47:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	its saying permission denied..
2008-02-07T16:48:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	i did .... :(
2008-02-07T16:48:00.000Z	frost0	_dml	doh!..i had synaptic open...
2008-02-07T16:48:00.000Z	_dml	frost0	it asked you for your password ?
