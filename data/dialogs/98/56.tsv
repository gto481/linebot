2006-08-11T11:17:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	My install is only at 4 GB disk usage right now and I have been using it for quite a while so 7 is plenty unless you intend to store a bunch of files o nit
2006-08-22T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	 huh ?
2006-09-03T10:44:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	should have no problems with that
2006-10-01T15:34:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	mounting disks is the same regardless of kubuntu, ubuntu, or fedora for that matter
2006-10-28T09:16:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is always ugly, that's given
2007-01-19T08:20:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	the bot only reports back on the description given in the package
2007-01-19T08:21:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	and why this programer didn't put the record too.
2007-01-19T10:28:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	why it is quite dangeruos
2007-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	ask ubotu about that, I mean the obvious answer is that it is trying to convert an rpm to a deb and think about it, if they were really so easily converted, there really wouldn't be a difference between them
2007-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	man i have converted much time from rpm to deb and no problems
2007-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	did oyu have problems
2007-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	did you.
2007-01-19T10:32:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	I have never done it but it seems logical that there would be issues or someone is lazy or something. If converting them was so easy, then there really would be no difference at all. I have never converted, there is always source so just go with that if there isn't a deb
2007-01-19T10:33:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	man you know how to source.And there have peoples who don't know how to source
2007-01-19T10:33:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	for that they want to convert.
2007-01-19T10:34:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	compile somethime give big errors.
2007-01-19T10:34:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	it gives you errors, then you get the dependencies it wants. It tells you what to do
2007-01-19T10:35:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	but there have peoples who don't know after that when error come what to do.
2007-01-19T10:35:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	why don't you make some manual.
2007-01-19T10:35:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	I am sure there are some that exist that far exceed what I know
2007-01-19T10:36:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	ok where what is the page.
2007-01-19T10:36:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	ok i will see it.
2007-01-23T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	do you mean to install it and use it as your regular OS, or to make it a portable live cd kind of thing because only the latter is possible from what I have read
2007-01-23T08:31:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	i want to install it and use it like OS.
2007-01-23T08:31:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	good luck, seems unlikely
2007-01-23T08:31:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	why man tell fast
2007-01-23T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	is it can damage the pen drive
2007-01-23T08:32:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	there are issues with mounting and just a lot of things to consider, maybe it is possible. Conceptually seems a bit far off
2007-01-23T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	but is it can damage it
2007-01-23T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	liike from much read/write
2007-01-23T08:33:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	I doubt it would damage anything
2007-01-23T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	damage everything like what man, tel fast
2007-01-23T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	becouse i install it in the moment
2007-01-23T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	no i want to install it and when i need it to use it.
2007-01-23T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	what other language do you speak?
2007-01-23T08:38:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	spanish
2007-02-06T06:35:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	new partition you are installing ubuntu on
2007-02-06T06:35:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	I would do manually edit just to be certain
2007-02-06T06:37:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	just go to manually edit
2007-02-06T08:34:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	it will still be here
2007-02-06T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	and when new version will be out are you going to install it
2007-02-06T08:35:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	yes
2007-02-06T08:36:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	ok man thanks for the reply.
2007-02-28T08:00:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	i install WIndows VIsta and now i can't boot UBuntu
2007-02-28T08:12:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	i try the first option and it won work
2007-02-28T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	/dev/hda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
2007-02-28T08:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	no see this /dev/hda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
2007-04-09T05:41:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is not an upgrade of xubuntu
2007-05-02T06:34:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	ultimate is unnecessary and pointless
2007-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	feisty mounts everything you got when you install
2007-05-19T08:12:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	: i do lol
2007-05-21T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	links
2007-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	i'm on ubuntu server
2007-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	so
2007-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	use the first one
2007-06-17T10:20:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	i read and how to backup total?
2007-06-17T10:20:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	do what it says tar up /
2007-06-17T10:21:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	and after that,they have example with only one directory
2007-06-17T10:22:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	no, the tutorial is how to back up the entire system, you tar up / and then to restore you untar it
2007-06-17T10:23:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	this one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR
2007-06-17T10:23:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	bah,again
2007-06-17T10:24:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	what was one file system?
2007-06-17T10:24:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	your question doesn't make sense
2007-06-17T10:24:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	bah,man i make this and after that when restore it say that have error?
2007-06-17T10:25:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	tar up /, then untar it at /, when you untar it, it will overwrite every file in your system
2007-06-17T10:25:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	We don't want to backup everything since some dirs aren't very useful to include.?
2007-06-17T10:25:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	yeah that is what the tutorial says
2007-06-17T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	such as proc
2007-06-17T10:26:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	and i want all system.
2007-06-17T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	proc is dynamic, it holds your processes, your processes will differ, it does not good to back it up
2007-06-17T10:27:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	man,ok help some little
2007-06-17T10:28:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	to backup,apache,mysql,and all important thing what i need to write/
2007-06-17T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	just follow the idea, tar up what you want, and then untar it later to replace
2007-06-17T10:29:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	but i don't know what is important
2007-06-17T10:29:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	well figure that out
2007-06-17T10:29:00.000Z	ubuntu	bruenig	apache,mysql and the all important things.
2007-06-25T12:27:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is slow amongst the distros
2007-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is a good starter distro, all linux distros with the exception of gentoo should install in less than an hour or so depending on specs
2007-07-29T11:56:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	doesn't recognize cards, the kernel does
2007-08-04T07:31:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	needs to provide includes, what possible purpose does it serve to split them
2007-08-06T16:47:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	doesn't do new kernel releases between versions, not actual new versions iirc
2007-08-16T05:46:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is amongst the worst distros for battery conservation
2007-08-19T16:55:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is friendly to new users
2007-08-30T11:44:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	ultimate doesn't have its own repos
2007-09-13T15:38:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	on a server is eww enough
2007-09-16T09:04:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is nothing at all like gentoo, none
2007-09-16T09:08:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	gets the most hits per day, that is not a measurement of popularity
2007-09-24T14:19:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	ultimate is on the same line as ubuntu christian edition both being horrific jokes
2007-10-12T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is one of the slower distro, especially in boot time, good jesus allah on boot time
2007-11-03T07:27:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	didn't make windows not recognize the 160 gigs
2007-11-06T12:08:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	be clearer
2007-11-15T21:36:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	constantly being behind though actually makes you want to do the opposite because you want up to date software
2007-12-09T03:47:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is not spelled with all capital letters iirc
2007-12-09T04:44:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	still installs plugins in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins right?
2008-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is complex because everything is abstracted
2008-04-14T06:06:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is a good alternative to linux if that is what you meant by linux alternative
2008-04-14T06:30:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	doesn't do the .xinitrc fun, so how do you do this stuff
2008-10-06T20:33:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu	is a package manager and init scripts
