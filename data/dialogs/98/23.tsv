2009-01-05T17:59:00.000Z	Maggie		what dependencies are required to update gvfs?
2009-01-05T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	update-manager takes care of updates for you
2009-01-05T18:00:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	what if i want to do it manually ?
2009-01-05T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	It's usually not a good idea, especially with core things like gvfs, unless you already know what you are doing.  Why do you want to?
2009-01-05T18:02:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	coz a frien of mine uninstalled nautilus
2009-01-05T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	so install it again?
2009-01-05T18:02:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	how?
2009-01-05T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	use APT, with for example Synaptic
2009-01-05T18:04:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	it is there when i look in package manager
2009-01-05T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	so what is the problem?
2009-01-05T18:05:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	when i open places>computer i get the msg "Error stating file '/usr/share/applications/nautilus-computer.desktop': No such file or directory"
2009-01-05T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	what did your friend do exactly?
2009-01-05T18:07:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	I had this problem that while opening places>computer I got msg "Nautilus cannot handle Computer: locations"
2009-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	you said your friend removed nautilus.  What did he do exactly?
2009-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	can i pm you?
2009-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	no, I'd prefer it if we use the channel
2009-01-05T18:09:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	so i used irc to seek help
2009-01-05T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	ok, but for me to help you, can you answer my question?
2009-01-05T18:11:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	i was told to update gvfs using source code...... so i tried to do it but i was unsuccessful when my friend came and i asked him to help
2009-01-05T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	you need to be more specific about what your friend has done
2009-01-05T18:14:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	then he downloaded gvfs_0.99.1-1_i386.deb and installed it and after installation we got msg that it was broken and we should write sudo apt-get install -f in the terminal and that uninstalled nautilus
2009-01-05T18:15:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	pastebin: apt-cache policy gvfs
2009-01-05T18:16:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	this is what i got http://paste.ubuntu.com/100304/

2009-01-05T19:26:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	7 hours
2009-01-05T19:27:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	k.  The only other thing I would check for is what do you have installed to /usr/local/?
2009-01-05T19:27:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	how do i do that
2009-01-05T19:28:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	ls /usr/local/*
2009-01-05T19:30:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	this was my output http://paste.ubuntu.com/100343/
2009-01-05T19:30:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	you have glib installed there.  Why?
2009-01-05T19:31:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	it was required when i was installing something from source code
2009-01-05T19:32:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	so why not use the repositories?
2009-01-05T19:32:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	what did you install from source code that you want to keep anyway?
2009-01-05T19:33:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	to keep a backup  coz u know i have a slow connection
2009-01-05T19:34:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	Cmake
2009-01-05T19:34:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	cmake is in the repositories.  Let's get rid of the /usr/local/ stuff.  'sudo mv /usr/local/ /usr/local.old && sudo mkdir /usr/local/' and then reboot
2009-01-05T19:35:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	nothing happened
2009-01-05T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	what does 'ls /usr/local/' say now?
2009-01-05T19:37:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	this was the output "http://paste.ubuntu.com/100346/"
2009-01-05T19:38:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	so reboot
2009-01-05T19:39:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	just have a look at this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=801597
2009-01-05T19:43:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	thanx its all working now
2009-01-05T19:43:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	no problem
2009-01-05T19:44:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	be wary about compiling things from source, especially core libraries.  Most are in the repository anyway
2009-01-05T19:45:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	thanx again but what if want a newer version
2009-01-05T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	a newer version of what?
2009-01-05T19:46:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	of what i want to download and its old available in the repository e.g. vlc
2009-01-05T19:47:00.000Z	jrib	Maggie	feel free to compile vlc, but not the libraries it depends on since those are in the repositories
2009-01-05T19:49:00.000Z	Maggie	jrib	thanx I was a real pain eh!
