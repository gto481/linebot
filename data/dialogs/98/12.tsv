2010-01-02T08:36:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	where I made the original mistake was going to the Adobe website to get the download
2010-01-02T08:36:00.000Z	EastDallas	NamVet	Yeah, there's a version of flash that works fine available via Synaptic
2010-01-02T08:37:00.000Z	EastDallas	NamVet	Unfortunately, we were all trained to go to the website from using Windows
2010-01-02T08:37:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	rgr I originally went in synaptic and did a search and it gave the link for the adobe flashplayer? new to Ubuntu so I clicked the link and the sheet hit the proverbial fan
2010-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	been installing Ubuntu on our computer club members' pc like crazy, they love it
2010-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	EastDallas	NamVet	 YOu might need to enable the optional repositories in Synaptic.  Settings>Repositories>make sure the top 4 boxes are checked on the first tab
2010-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	they are already checked
2010-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	EastDallas	NamVet	Is reinstalling an option at this point?  I've googled this error, and haven't really found any resolution other than that patch.
2010-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	Setting>repositories>software
2010-01-02T08:42:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	I don't mind reinstall, done it a couple of times. but not to happy about losing personal files. I have a 8 gig flashusb but don't know how to get files to it from Terminal
2010-01-02T08:42:00.000Z	EastDallas	NamVet	I don't understand how you got a link to the adobe website in Synaptic?!?!  The package is adobe-flashplugin.
2010-01-02T08:42:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	also a 40gb external hard drive.
2010-01-02T08:43:00.000Z	NamVet	EastDallas	that's it adobe-flashplugin

2010-01-02T08:44:00.000Z	EastDallas	NamVet	 Boot to an Ubuntu install CD.  Choose the option to try ubuntu without making any changes to your computer.  You will boot to a desktop where you can use nautilus to move the files to your flash drive or usb hard drive.
