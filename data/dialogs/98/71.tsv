2005-09-24T15:02:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	since I have never used it, and I do hear good things about it, why about e17 don't you like so I can weigh that against the good?
2005-09-24T15:02:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	I couldn't get used to the way it works/doesn't work in the few days I tried it
2005-09-25T16:19:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	why don't you upgrade now?
2005-09-25T16:20:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	oh, no, that's way too much for me to handle right now, I'm just catching up. ;)
2005-09-25T16:20:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	breezy is pretty stable :)
2005-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	lol
2005-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	stop using crappy backports
2005-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	I just did what I was told to do on the Forums, nothing else
2005-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	the forums are filled with idiots...
2005-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	lol
2005-09-28T14:01:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	the mods and admins are not the smartest per se
2005-09-28T14:02:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	apt-show-versions | grep ubp | xargs aptitude remove
2005-09-28T14:03:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	I get errors with that command
2005-09-28T14:03:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	then you need to do it manually :)
2005-09-28T14:11:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	now my firefox doesn't start at all
2005-09-28T14:12:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	your own fault
2005-09-28T14:12:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	I don't know what I'm doing, I just did what I was told when I installed Ubuntu
2005-09-28T14:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	it's not my fault I have bad advice, please be nice....
2005-09-28T14:14:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	sorry, it's just that I have seen so much mess coming from the old backports that I hate them now
2005-09-28T14:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	I understand, but I'm sorry, the wiki is very confusing
2005-09-28T14:15:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	mods are just forum regulars
2005-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	ubuntuguide.org sucks and is down too
2005-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	see how confused I am
2005-09-28T15:47:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	nothing :)
2005-09-28T15:48:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	lol, ok but what about the software in them, might there be something I need?
2005-09-28T15:48:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	what did you use from backports?
2005-09-28T15:49:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	see, that's thing, i don't know how to distinguish what's from the backports and what isn't, is there a way?
2005-09-28T15:49:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	I guess java and mp3, is that the backports, I installed them in june
2005-09-28T15:50:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	apt-show-versions | grep ubp
2005-09-28T15:51:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	yeah, I do, sudo apt-get install apt-show-versions?
2005-09-28T15:52:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	yes
2005-09-28T15:53:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	ok, so installed, and I ran that command, what is the info?
2005-09-28T15:54:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	that' just the "Offical" stuff? if I have something not in there, it's from the backports?
2005-09-28T15:54:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	apt-show-versions | grep ubp
2005-09-28T15:55:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	yeah, that's what I'm saying, I ran that command, what is the info, just the "official" stuff anything else was installed via Backports or on my own, ie Americas Army
2005-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	Ubuntu is pretty unique in a lot of ways eh?
2005-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	unique in goodness :)
2005-09-28T16:00:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	to me Ubuntu is the ideal mix of stability, recent packages, good support and a fabulous community
2005-09-29T16:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	it's too bad there is a lot of emphasis on the forums if they are sending the wrong information
2005-09-29T16:33:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	rotflmao, that's funny
2005-09-29T16:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	what do they do?
2005-09-29T16:42:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	you must have developed a strong bond with ubotu by now
2005-09-29T05:57:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	sweet dreams
2005-10-08T16:53:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	scale -- package is building...

2005-10-08T16:58:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	that was very nice of you to take the time to do that for us, thanx
2005-10-08T05:13:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	try 7za -e filename.7z
2005-10-08T05:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	that's what I did, I forgot the ">" in that last line
2005-10-08T05:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	I didn't really use the <>
2005-10-08T05:14:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	ah ok
2005-10-08T05:15:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	7za e instead of 7za -e
2005-10-08T05:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	Seveas	yeah, bingo, isn't the "-" used to define the option though? Why does it work without it?
2005-10-08T05:16:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	read 'man 7za' :)
2005-10-08T05:17:00.000Z	Seveas	tristanmike	that specific one is quite clear
