2006-11-03T11:32:00.000Z	ty		BCM43xx wirless: Any suggestions?
2006-11-03T11:32:00.000Z	ty		tried fwcutter to no avail
2006-11-03T11:32:00.000Z	ty		ndiswrapper is not working well either
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	ty		any really good guides/wiki's?
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	what did it say when you tried it?
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	ty		nothing
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 What guide do you use for ndiswrapper?
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	i have bcm4306 on my powerbook and got it working
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 With what?
2006-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	i didn't use ndiswrapper, i extracted from an apple file on osx
2006-11-03T11:34:00.000Z	ty		lilandra:  How did you install it?
2006-11-03T11:34:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 My wireless light isn't even turning on
2006-11-03T11:34:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	well there's a file on OSX, AppleAirport2 which has the firmware and i used fwcutter to extract the firmware and store it in /lib/firmware and then did a modprobe
2006-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 Do you have a guide to that at all?
2006-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	it's kinda sketchy...hold on
2006-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	but i had the firmware in a file...not sure abot in windows
2006-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 I'm pretty sure I know where to find driver in windows
2006-11-03T11:36:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	http://lilandra.com/blog/archives/2006/08/02/wireless-on-powerbook-g4-with-airport-extreme-with-linux-instructions/

2006-11-03T11:36:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	and on gentoo: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-409194.html
2006-11-03T11:38:00.000Z	Lilandra		but ty, somebody once said it works well for the 4306 and iffy on other 43xx
2006-11-03T11:38:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 I have a 4306 bcm43xx
2006-11-03T11:38:00.000Z	ty		so it might work
2006-11-03T11:39:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	okay! i hope so! instructions are a tad sketchy but i used the lanterntorch and gentoo to help me
2006-11-03T11:46:00.000Z	ty		doesn't seem to be working lilandra
2006-11-03T11:46:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	what happens? :-(
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	ty		lilandra: don't know where to get those drivers
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	ty		Tried copying them from my windows files to no avail
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	when i installed edgy and reinstalled osx, i couldn't use the driver anymore and had to use the old version i saved
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	would my driver work? from apple?
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	ty		Lilandra; you have a copy?
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	ty		Maybe?
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	ty		Worth a shot
2006-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	Lilandra		hold on
2006-11-03T11:48:00.000Z	ty		lilandra: sudo bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware ~/Desktop/BCMWL5.INF
2006-11-03T11:48:00.000Z	ty		Extracting firmware from this file is IMPOSSIBLE. (e.g. too old/new)
2006-11-03T11:48:00.000Z	ty		there is the error

2006-11-03T12:18:00.000Z	ty		yes
2006-11-03T12:18:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	i remember struggling a bit more with edgy but i cant remember why
2006-11-03T12:18:00.000Z	Lilandra		hmm...
2006-11-03T12:19:00.000Z	ty		lilandra: you use ndiswrapper to any luck?
2006-11-03T12:19:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	i didn't use ndiswrapper...not sure what to do with it
2006-11-03T12:19:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	i'm beginning to think i was lucky
2006-11-03T12:20:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	but the modprobe worked, so what does that mean
2006-11-03T12:20:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 Sometimes it does just seem to be luck that gets these working:  Got skype working first time installed linux on my 64 bit processer...never got it to work again...
2006-11-03T12:20:00.000Z	Lilandra		yikes!
2006-11-03T12:21:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 any other suggestions?  I'm sick of trolling the forums...might be time to hook back up the usb dongle wireless
2006-11-03T12:21:00.000Z	ty	Lilandra	 Just had high hopes that I wouldn't have to use it...its kinda inconvient
2006-11-03T12:22:00.000Z	Lilandra	ty	right now no, i can...err...boot into a live cd and work from scratch and see if i forgot anything...tomorrow...:-(
2006-11-03T12:22:00.000Z	ty		that is fine
