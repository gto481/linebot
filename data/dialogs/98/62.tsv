2005-11-22T13:35:00.000Z	dvius		hehe
2005-11-22T13:35:00.000Z	dvius		i got some issues... could I pls ask for some help?
2005-11-22T13:36:00.000Z	dvius		I really like ubuntu, but I find that even though it's based on debian alot of debian stuff dont work... i'm a total noob, so maybe I'm just not understanding, but here goes...
2005-11-22T13:37:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 1) dont use debian based apt packages
2005-11-22T13:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 it does work, you have all the same things you find in debian... just dont use debian repositories in ubuntu....
2005-11-22T13:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 you sure dpkg dont work on your system? did you do a minuimum install or bork something?
2005-11-22T13:41:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 my guess is that was supposed to represent the prompt ;)
2005-11-22T13:42:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 you're in the right place then ;)
2005-11-22T13:45:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 try running mplayer from console, see if it chucks an error message in the output
2005-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 word of advice, remove those drivers and use the ubuntu packaged ones, its a lot simpler :)
2005-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 you have the exact same card as me and i dont use legacy
2005-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 use the --uninstall flag on the nvidia .run package then follow the nvidia link from ubotu
2005-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 and dop you have the right kernel package in stalled? whats your processor?
2005-11-22T14:03:00.000Z	dvius	aftertaf	I reinstalled my system again and haven't tried any nvidia packages since... should I follow "binarydriverHowto" advice a
2005-11-22T14:03:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 type sudo apt-get install linux-k7 and let it download away... then reboot with the k7 kernel :] 
2005-11-22T14:04:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 and then follow the howto for the restricted packages containing nvidia drivers, yeah :)
2005-11-22T14:05:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 for your kernel? cos linux does what you ask it to ;)
2005-11-22T14:08:00.000Z	dvius	aftertaf	Im sorry...."restricted packages"??
2005-11-22T14:12:00.000Z	dvius	aftertaf	THANKS HEAPS DUDE!! your a lifesaver. rebooting y maching be back in 5
2005-11-22T14:24:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 if it all goes horrible, you boot to console and edit the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf   change driver from "nvidia" to "nv"
2005-11-22T14:28:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 and write this down too: if it all goes pearshaped, you can : sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2005-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 howd it go?
2005-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	dvius	aftertaf	not good!
2005-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	aftertaf	dvius	 ah, whats the error?
