2004-09-27T16:20:00.000Z	mxpxpod		does anyone here use ubuntu on ppc?
2004-09-27T16:21:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	yeah
2004-09-27T16:21:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	how well does it work?
2004-09-27T16:23:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	it's rad.
2004-09-27T16:23:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	I'd like to try it out before I just blow away my debian setup... is there a live cd for ppc?
2004-09-27T09:54:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ok, so what's the main diff between ubuntu and debian?
2004-09-27T10:21:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	so, you have ubuntu installed on ppc, right?
2004-09-27T10:21:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	on my bright green toilet seat
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	lol, ok
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	and i've seen it installed and running on many other kinds.
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ok, good :)
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	does the mad phat startup stuff work on ppc?
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	mad phat startup will be in Hoary
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	oh, ok
2004-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	and will work on every arch
2004-09-27T10:23:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	awesome
2004-09-27T10:36:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	unlikely
2004-09-27T10:36:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	it's very well tested, and i've done the same thing on a number of machines
2004-09-27T12:51:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	can you answer that? why pbbuttonsd instead of pmud?
2004-09-27T12:55:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	pmud is not really a living project
2004-09-27T12:55:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	so we chose to ship pbbuttonsd
2004-09-27T12:55:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ok, that's cool
2004-09-27T12:55:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	as long as it comes with sane defaults
2004-09-27T12:56:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	my experience with it sucks (but I was using it on gentoo... so go figure)
2004-09-27T12:57:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	we sanified them a bit
2004-09-27T12:57:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	good
2004-09-27T14:55:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ping
2004-09-28T07:16:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	for junk checking
2004-09-28T07:16:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	you can turn it off
2004-09-28T07:16:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	I want it to check junk, but it shouldn't spawn a new process if I have spamd running already
2004-09-28T07:17:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	it uses a user-spamd for some reason
2004-09-28T07:29:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	where do you work?
2004-09-28T07:30:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	little professional services company called canonical
2004-09-28T07:30:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	located in .au, I would guess
2004-09-28T07:30:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	isle of man, as it happens
2004-09-28T07:31:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	I'd like to find a company where I could work on GNOME all day long :)
2004-09-28T07:31:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	hehe
2004-09-28T07:33:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	ross works on javur
2004-09-28T08:28:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	perhaps in universe, but legal concerns, yada yada. we'll see.
2004-09-28T08:28:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	heh, damn legal concerns :)
2004-09-28T08:28:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	I guess for now I'll have to install it manually
2004-09-28T08:30:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	why are schemas still installed in /etc/gconf?
2004-09-28T08:30:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	we froze before those changes
2004-09-28T08:30:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ah, ok
2004-09-28T08:30:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	also, seb128 is lame
2004-09-28T08:32:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	did you talk to jbailey about the escaping fix in evo-exchange?
2004-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	no
2004-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	I guess evo-exchange escapes some stuff that exchange servers don't like escaped
2004-09-28T08:36:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	well, basically ;)
2004-09-28T09:00:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	how much is it going to cost to get that package in?
2004-09-28T09:06:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	legal issues
2004-09-28T09:07:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	install totem-xine
2004-09-28T09:08:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	I did and it says it can't play windows media video 9
2004-09-28T09:17:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	they're on the list for hoary

2004-09-28T09:20:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	are those only i386 binaries in your repo?
2004-09-28T09:26:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	that's a lot of asking :)
2004-09-28T09:30:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	can you compile those gnome-bluetooth packages for ppc when you get time?
2004-09-28T09:30:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	not really
2004-09-28T09:31:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	darn

2004-10-03T14:33:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	why did you choose bogofilter over sa?
2004-10-03T14:34:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	due to a serious misbalance in rules vs. sucks.
2004-10-03T14:40:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	so, I don't need sa installed...
2004-10-03T14:40:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	the evo spam stuff still uses SA
2004-10-03T14:41:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ok... so explain to me this bogofilter hack you did...
2004-10-03T14:41:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	it's not present
2004-10-03T14:41:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	oh, ok
2004-10-03T15:35:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	how did you get the ubuntu1 in the names of your .debs?
2004-10-03T15:36:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	the version is taken from the top changelog entry
2004-10-03T15:36:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ahhh
2004-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	so you updated the changelogs... ok
2004-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	when you change a package, you have to update the changelog
2004-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	gotcha
2004-10-04T08:34:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	do you guys have a *mm maintainer?
2004-10-08T08:22:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	ok, I figured out what was wrong with SA
2004-10-08T08:23:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	for some reason, it was using bogofilter as well as itself... which wasw strange to me
2004-11-21T09:38:00.000Z	jdub	mxpxpod	not strong plans, but if you want to help out...
2004-11-21T09:38:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	if I had more time, I would
2004-11-21T09:38:00.000Z	mxpxpod	jdub	or if I was hired by canonical......
