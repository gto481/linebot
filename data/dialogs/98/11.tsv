2010-03-03T01:17:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	i dont know, it doest detect my ipod
2010-03-03T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	try installing it, you may have to mount the device like a partition, unfortunately you have a device from one of the most closed minded companys out there
2010-03-03T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	the latest wine with some versions of itunes does actually work
2010-03-03T01:19:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	yeah i dont like apple, but ipod touch, i just love it
2010-03-10T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	uname -a   if you see i686 its 32bit x86_64 is 64bit
2010-03-10T16:06:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	it is 32 bit, is there anyway i can change mine to 64 bit withouht re installing the whole os?
2010-03-10T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	no, you must reinstall the 64bit OS
2010-03-10T16:07:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	oh, i see. So installing the 64 bit kernel wont work, thanks gor i asked here, i was about to do something stupid.
2010-03-10T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	how much ram do you have?
2010-03-10T16:08:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	2 GB, Why?
2010-03-10T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	then 32bit is fine, it can reference your ram without issue, if you had >3Gb ram then you'd need 64bit (or PAE kernel)
2010-03-10T16:09:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	no i thought 64bit OS could speed up my system a lil bit. :O
2010-03-10T16:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	only if you do a lot of data transforms (like audio encoding etc)
2010-03-10T16:10:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	oh, is it? so for normal use i wont be seeing much difference?
2010-03-10T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	for normal web / dtp /chat you wont see any difference

2010-05-14T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	you may need some power settings adding, or some module options. It can be loads of things. The web will tell you. There may also be a guide for your model on www.laptoplinux.com
2010-09-05T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	on the login screen log on as ubuntu with no pass then run: sudo gdm start

2011-04-08T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	does it happen in all browsers?
2011-04-08T17:54:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	i have only ff4, i ll download chrome and try
2011-04-08T18:12:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	the problem is oly for firefox, in chrome the fonts are getting displayed without any issue
2011-04-08T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	ok then try renaming ~/.mozilla then rerun the browser. I don't use firefox so am not much help but certainly can help diagnose
2011-04-08T18:14:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	ok let me try. thanks for helping!
2011-04-08T18:15:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	no change, still the blank page
2011-04-08T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	ok then rename the old folder back, restoring your old settings
2011-04-08T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	so now we know its an app issue, not settings
2011-04-08T18:16:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	so reinstalling might be able to fix it?
2011-04-08T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	thats as far as I can go, I ditched firefox ages ago and use arora and chromium daily
2011-04-08T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	worth a try
2011-04-08T18:17:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	ok.
2011-06-18T16:53:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	i saw one of your questions regarding using proxy ofr transmission bitorrent client in launchpad, did you manage to do that?
2011-06-18T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	i don't use a proxy but it can be done
2012-10-20T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	does mount do it?
2012-10-20T01:02:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	yes actually I have mounted it wwith qemu tool. But now I have a directory with a file in it. I don't know what to do with that file! :/
2012-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	what is the file for exactly?
2012-10-20T01:05:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	I didn't get your question I am sorry? Which file?
2012-10-20T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	the file you mounted....
2012-10-20T01:08:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	That file is a vdi file with mac filesystem. I need to get access to a file from that partition very badly.
2012-10-20T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	well you said it was mounted, so you can access the data via the mount point
2012-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-mount-virtualbox-drive-image-vdi-in-ubuntu-12-1012-04.html   seems it uses vdfuse to mount it
2012-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	yeah thats what! :( The mounted partition just has one file. I guess its some other kind of filesystem. I tried my luck using hfsplus but no use
2012-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	its how you can mount the vdi, you could ask in #vbox maybe
2012-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	I tried that link you gave me. What happens is, when I do the last step, it shows me an error saying I need to specify the partition type!
2012-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	obscurant1st	ActionParsnip	ok, I will try with them then. :)
