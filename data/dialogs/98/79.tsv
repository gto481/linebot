2004-12-10T07:17:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	run it from the menu or with sudo
2004-12-10T07:17:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_	ogra	From the menu it doesnt want to pen up, Ive ran it fine with sudo

2004-12-10T07:18:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	weird
2004-12-10T07:19:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	could you look in the preferences of the starter ?
2004-12-10T07:19:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	i.e. right click the menu entry
2004-12-10T07:20:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	i.e. right click the menu entry and tell me what is there in the command field ?

2004-12-10T07:25:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	i mean  gksudo startup-settings not sudo startup-settings
2004-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	hmm, you can run things like synaptic ?
2004-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_	ogra	not as my default user
2004-12-10T07:28:00.000Z	ogra	_|Imanewbie|_	ahh....that drops another light on it....i thought it was the app :)
