2009-12-13T04:32:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Right click on the drive and go to properties?  What does it have for "filesystem type"?
2009-12-13T04:33:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Type folder (inode/directory)
2009-12-13T04:35:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Can you copy files to any other location on the drive? Or is the entire drive read only?
2009-12-13T04:35:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	The entire drive :(
2009-12-13T04:36:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	You may have to install the storage device manager... "sudo apt-get install pysdm"
2009-12-13T04:38:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	I'm on a Live CD.
2009-12-13T04:38:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	ok that makes it more difficult...
2009-12-13T04:39:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Yeah my sisters computed crashed, so I'm trying my best to get the files off of it.
2009-12-13T04:39:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Oh i see...
2009-12-13T04:40:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	You could still install pysdm from the live cd.
2009-12-13T04:41:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Just go to applications -> acessories -> terminal
2009-12-13T04:41:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	...and type "sudo apt-get install pysdm"  it's worth a try
2009-12-13T04:41:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	E: Couldn't find package pysdm.
2009-12-13T04:43:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	As aperson suggested try system -> adiminstration -> update manager
2009-12-13T04:45:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Okay, I gotta download the 235.8 megs so might be a while :S
2009-12-13T04:46:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Ok now were getting somewhere, hopefully
2009-12-13T04:46:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Yeah, it's just kinda annoying you just can't chown && chmod it.
2009-12-13T04:47:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	yeah drives are different...
2009-12-13T04:55:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Everything Ok?
2009-12-13T04:56:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Yeah still downloading.
2009-12-13T05:03:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Still downloading ?
2009-12-13T05:03:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Almost done :)
2009-12-13T05:03:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	And then it has to install :) shouldn't take as long though
2009-12-13T05:08:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	By the way, don't restart the computer.  Even if it asks you to.
2009-12-13T05:10:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	I'll assume it's still installing ...
2009-12-13T05:10:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	44 seconds :)
2009-12-13T05:11:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	Now installing it.
2009-12-13T05:13:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Ok tell me when it's done

2009-12-13T05:19:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Go to Settings -> Repositories
2009-12-13T05:20:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	I'm getting erros when launching Synaptic, then it crashes.
2009-12-13T05:21:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	What do the errors say
2009-12-13T05:23:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	dpkg: failed to write status record about 'jfsutils' to '/var/lib/dpkg/status': NO space left on device
2009-12-13T05:25:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	E: dpkg was interruped, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a" to correct the problem.
2009-12-13T05:26:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Are you using ubuntu 9.10 Or 9.04

2009-12-13T05:41:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Good! when you click sdb's down arrow (if it has one) how many partitions does it have?

2009-12-13T05:59:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	then apply and try?
2009-12-13T06:00:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Yeah.  You may have to unplug and replug the drive... and then try copying files.
2009-12-13T06:00:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	sure.
2009-12-13T06:01:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	i try to unmount it but it says it's not mounted?
2009-12-13T06:01:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Just unplug it then and plug it back in.
2009-12-13T06:02:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	the destination is read-only..
2009-12-13T06:03:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	 Hmm that should have worked and I think we're stuck...
2009-12-13T06:04:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	how do you suggest moving 40gbs off the hard drive? :)
2009-12-13T06:05:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Does she have any specific folders that she wants to keep.  You don't need copy all the programs and Windows
2009-12-13T06:06:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	that's exactly what im doing
2009-12-13T06:06:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	How big is your flash drive?
2009-12-13T06:07:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	4 gigs.
2009-12-13T06:07:00.000Z	rCX	HamptonSam	Okay you may have to copy 1/10th of her files at a time to another computer then.
2009-12-13T06:08:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	sigh.. okay.
2009-12-13T06:08:00.000Z	HamptonSam	rCX	i really appreciate your help.
