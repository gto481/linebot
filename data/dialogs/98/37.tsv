2008-03-13T04:51:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	the driver is usually on a CD that came with your wireless interface
2008-03-13T04:51:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	or on the company who made the device's website.
2008-03-13T04:52:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	it's a wireless card in my laptop :/
2008-03-13T04:52:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	what brand and model is it?

2008-03-13T04:55:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	I'll try and figure out what card is in it. If I can't there's a command that will tell me.
2008-03-13T04:55:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Thanks :)
2008-03-13T04:58:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Ah, it's a AirForce 51g.. I'm just not sure how to install the driver
2008-03-13T04:58:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	I'll look it up, thanks
2008-03-13T04:58:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	ok, thanks :)
2008-03-13T05:00:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	can you pastebin the output of lspci for me please?
2008-03-13T05:01:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	http://pastebin.com/f3292519e
2008-03-13T05:03:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	found what I was looking for. Now I can get you install info. Give me a minute.
2008-03-13T05:03:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Thanks :)!
2008-03-13T05:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	this is a really stupid question, but are you sure that it isn't working by default? (Like, have you checked the network-manager-gnome applet thing in the upper right hand corner for signals?) Then I'll feel good referring you to this guide. Otherwise it's just a waste ;)
2008-03-13T05:06:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Well it has "Enable Wireless" on, but I'm not sure if that means anything really :/
2008-03-13T05:06:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	left-click it
2008-03-13T05:06:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	And?
2008-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	does it have a field for "Wireless" in the box?
2008-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	then your wireless is working.
2008-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Yes
2008-03-13T05:08:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	:O
2008-03-13T05:08:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Oh, thanks for pointing that out :D! You know how I can dispose of all this ndiswrapper stuff I have installed :S?
2008-03-13T05:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	yeah, give me a minute, I have a phone call.
2008-03-13T05:09:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Thanks
2008-03-13T05:11:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	yeah, it's basically just two things if I remember correctly that you need to remove
2008-03-13T05:12:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	first, do sudo aptitude purge ndiswrapper ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper modules-1.9 ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2008-03-13T05:16:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	http://pastebin.com/m80391b0
2008-03-13T05:16:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	taking a look
2008-03-13T05:17:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	my mistake
2008-03-13T05:17:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	first, do sudo aptitude purge ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-modules-1.9 ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2008-03-13T05:19:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	http://pastebin.com/mc675825
2008-03-13T05:22:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	hmm, it doesn't look like you even installed it. (At least from the ubuntu repository) but just to check, please pastebin the output of dpkg -l | grep -i ndiswrapper (note that the character after the '-' is an L and the thing after it is a pipe (above the enter key on most keyboards))
2008-03-13T05:31:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	are you still around?
2008-03-13T05:44:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Sorry, was washing dishes
2008-03-13T05:44:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	ah, that's alright, by all means continue.
2008-03-13T05:47:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	so did you try the command I gave you earlier? (the dpkg -l one)
2008-03-13T05:49:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Yeah
2008-03-13T05:49:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	it showed nothing
2008-03-13T05:50:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	Okay...so how did you install ndiswrapper?
2008-03-13T05:51:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	I ran what it said to run in compile and install here: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,installation/
2008-03-13T05:51:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	Ouch
2008-03-13T05:52:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	this might be a bit messy. I'll see how they installed it and see if I can safely remove it all.
2008-03-13T05:52:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	in the future, be sure to install stuff through either Synaptic or Add/Remove Programs.
2008-03-13T05:53:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	it's way easier to install for one, and it's really simple to uninstall as well.
2008-03-13T05:53:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	I didn't know you could install ndiswrapper through that
2008-03-13T05:54:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	it's alright. I was just telling you for the future
2008-03-13T05:54:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Alright, well thanks for all your help ^^
2008-03-13T05:54:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	so you have the latest source from sourceforge?
2008-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	1.52.tar.gz
2008-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Yes
2008-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	is it fair to assume you still have the uncompressed folder on your hard drive?
2008-03-13T05:56:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	if not, we can just redownload it.
2008-03-13T05:57:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Yeah it's there
2008-03-13T06:03:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	lol sorry netadmins IRC on another server is glitching and he's flooding for an unknown reason, and were trying to contain it
2008-03-13T06:03:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	ah, no problem
2008-03-13T06:04:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Anyway, the uncompressed is on my hd
2008-03-13T06:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	 cool. I need you to open up a terminal and navigate to that folder (I assume you know how to do this?)
2008-03-13T06:05:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Yes
2008-03-13T06:06:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	excellent. Now that you're there, run sudo make uninstall
2008-03-13T06:07:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	NOTE: Not all installed files are removed, as different distributions install ndiswrapper files at different places.
2008-03-13T06:08:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	yes, it does indeed say that. It then states that you just have to run it multiple times so it works (not sure why it works like that though)
2008-03-13T06:08:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	How would I know if it's off :P ?
2008-03-13T06:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	as it states, you wait until it no longer says "removing"
2008-03-13T06:10:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	http://pastebin.com/m74ec8e3 thats all I get when using that command
2008-03-13T06:11:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Now anyway
2008-03-13T06:11:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	but it said things the first time?
2008-03-13T06:12:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Yes
2008-03-13T06:13:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	excellent. It should be removed...let me just double check anything you did on the guide
2008-03-13T06:14:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	How far in the guide did you get?
2008-03-13T06:15:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	To where I was _looking_ for the driver, however I did run two commands that sYn_0n3 had mentioned
2008-03-13T06:16:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	what were they?
2008-03-13T06:17:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	sudo ndiswrapper -i windows driver and sudo ndiswrapper -i .inf file
2008-03-13T06:17:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	alright, there's one last thing I have to check then
2008-03-13T06:17:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	check /etc/modules and make sure that ndiswrapper isn't listed there.
2008-03-13T06:19:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	can't find a modules folder
2008-03-13T06:19:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	as long as ndiswrapper isn't listed, you're fine. If it is, just open it as root "sudo nano /etc/modules" and delete it from the file. Just reboot, then you're all set!
2008-03-13T06:19:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	it's a file, not a folder
2008-03-13T06:20:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	I have to reboot my router, brb in like 5 mins.
2008-03-13T06:22:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	sorry about that. Back
2008-03-13T06:22:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	so, did you check the file?
2008-03-13T06:23:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	ok, and I checked the file, it's nothing about ndiswrapper
2008-03-13T06:23:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	excellent. Then you're clena
2008-03-13T06:24:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Okay, thanks a lot for your help ^^, one more question though, is there a place were you can look at Wireless networks in the area?
2008-03-13T06:24:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	that would be left clicking the Network-Manager-Applet and looking at the list
2008-03-13T06:25:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Is that only possible if there are wireless networks in the area? I can't see a list selections :/
2008-03-13T06:26:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	yes, it would show networks in the area. For example, in the beginning, you saw the network "test"
2008-03-13T06:26:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	Okay, thanks then :)
2008-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	np
2008-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	you could also try iwlist wlan0 scan
2008-03-13T06:30:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	In terminal?
2008-03-13T06:30:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	yeah
2008-03-13T06:30:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	wlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning. :/
2008-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sindacious	ah, well sorry I can't help further at this point as I must depart. I'd recommend trying to get kismet as well, "the king of wireless scanners" sudo apt-get install kismet. It's launched by sudo kismet -i wlan0. Good luck!
2008-03-13T06:32:00.000Z	Sindacious	Megaqwerty	:) Thanks
