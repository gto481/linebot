2005-02-28T13:05:00.000Z	ells	tritium	what is up
2005-02-28T13:05:00.000Z	tritium	ells	hello :)  Just getting ready to sleep.  You?
2005-02-28T13:05:00.000Z	ells	tritium	got a quick question
2005-02-28T13:07:00.000Z	tritium	ells	rm -rf dir/
2005-02-28T13:08:00.000Z	tritium	ells	use chmod to change the permissions
2005-02-28T13:31:00.000Z	ells	tritium	my keyboard for my laptop is intermittently doing crazy stuff. Is there a way i can reset the keboard
2005-02-28T13:32:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you could try "reset"
2005-02-28T13:57:00.000Z	tritium	ells	wouldn't you rather use the gnome keyboard configuration tool?
2005-03-02T09:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I got a question for you
2005-03-02T09:39:00.000Z	tritium	ells	ok
2005-03-02T09:40:00.000Z	ells	tritium	when I hooked up my hard drive to the ribbon, it would not boot, when I unhooked the drive and started it, it went to try to find the drive. of course it didnt, but I was wondering if you know why
2005-03-02T09:40:00.000Z	ells	tritium	or if you have an idea
2005-03-02T09:41:00.000Z	tritium	ells	did you hook the drive up correctly?
2005-03-02T09:42:00.000Z	ells	tritium	honestly, I think so
2005-03-02T09:43:00.000Z	ells	tritium	could there be something wrong with the board. It just is crazy that the board will boot with nothing hooked up, but wont when the drives are hooked to the ribbons
2005-03-02T09:44:00.000Z	tritium	ells	is the drive new and possibly unsupported by the mobo?
2005-03-02T09:46:00.000Z	ells	tritium	the computer wont boot with either the cdrom or hard drive hooked up.
2005-03-02T09:46:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I am leaning to the mother board somehow being bad
2005-03-02T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	ells	sounds possible.
2005-03-02T09:47:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it is unfortunate, I was gonna makek a little network with that old computer
2005-03-02T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	ells	too bad :(
2005-03-02T09:49:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeah, I will try to find a new board this week. hopefully cheap
2005-03-02T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'm taking off.  See you later.
2005-03-07T10:18:00.000Z	ells	tritium	what is up

2005-03-07T10:29:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'll be back after lunch...
2005-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I tried those sources and it messed up my firestarter. i had to go back. additionally, it still gave me that error
2005-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	can you recommend another dvd rip program
2005-03-09T10:02:00.000Z	tritium	ells	hey there.
2005-03-09T10:07:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I got my new computer together. the new board has video onboard and doe not play well with linux
2005-03-09T10:07:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it talks about the frame buffer
2005-03-09T10:08:00.000Z	tritium	ells	what video chip?
2005-03-09T10:08:00.000Z	ells	tritium	i believe
2005-03-09T10:09:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I guess I will be forced to put windows on my new machine
2005-03-09T10:09:00.000Z	ells	tritium	at least for now.
2005-03-09T10:10:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you're sure there's no support for that chip?
2005-03-09T10:10:00.000Z	tritium	ells	what does lspci tell you it is?
2005-03-09T10:10:00.000Z	ells	tritium	i tried to install ubuntu and it locked up trying to enable the fram buffer or something
2005-03-09T10:25:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I will probably have to go buy a nice agp card
2005-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	ells	tritium	my old agp wont fit on this new board
2005-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	tritium	ells	did you check out lspci output?  what chip is it?
2005-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	ells	tritium	the slot seems to be different
2005-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I am putting xp on it
2005-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	ells	tritium	unfortunately
2005-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	tritium	ells	eww

2005-03-09T10:27:00.000Z	ells	tritium	something to do with the frame buffer
2005-03-09T10:31:00.000Z	ells	tritium	have agp cards changed the way the fit in the slots? just curious
2005-03-09T10:31:00.000Z	tritium	ells	no
2005-03-09T10:32:00.000Z	ells	tritium	i got it for my old desktop
2005-03-09T10:33:00.000Z	ells	tritium	they must have changed the way they fit into the newer boards
2005-03-09T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I don't think so, but I haven't bought hardware in a long tie
2005-03-09T10:34:00.000Z	ells	tritium	that is what I mean. i got this card almost 6 years ago
2005-03-09T10:35:00.000Z	tritium	ells	they made agp cards six years ago?
2005-03-09T10:36:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I think you have a standard pci slot and card
2005-03-09T10:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I am certain my card is agp
2005-03-09T10:40:00.000Z	tritium	ells	your new card, yes.  But I think your mobo has a standard pci slot
2005-03-09T10:41:00.000Z	tritium	ells	please run lspci
2005-03-09T10:41:00.000Z	ells	tritium	okay
2005-03-09T10:42:00.000Z	ells	tritium	will that work within windows
2005-03-09T10:42:00.000Z	tritium	ells	no
2005-03-09T10:42:00.000Z	tritium	ells	do you have a live CD?
2005-03-09T10:43:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yes
2005-03-09T10:44:00.000Z	tritium	ells	use that live CD.  If you run lspci, you can ascertain if you have AGP
2005-03-09T10:45:00.000Z	ells	tritium	cool
2005-03-09T11:00:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I ran it, what am I looking for

2005-03-09T11:07:00.000Z	ells	tritium	i took my old agp and tried to put it in my new computer
2005-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I really think that agp card slotting has changed
2005-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you might have a PCI Express
2005-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	ells	tritium	really
2005-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	ells	tritium	how would one know

2005-03-22T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	ells	why did you reinstall?
2005-03-22T07:55:00.000Z	ells	tritium	w32 is, but the other, I will check
2005-03-22T07:56:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I had crossweaver installed in hoary and all kind of errors came up
2005-03-22T07:58:00.000Z	ells	tritium	gstreamer was not installed, I will now see if my songs work

2005-03-22T08:11:00.000Z	tritium	ells	it depends on the application
2005-03-22T08:11:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it seems kind of associated
2005-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	gstreamer and xine, for example
2005-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	e.g., there's a totem-gstreamer, and a totem-xine

2005-03-24T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	ells	ok, so you could see text mode?
2005-03-24T12:11:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I even tried debian on my laptop, it worked but did not see my wireless card
2005-03-24T12:11:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeap
2005-03-24T12:11:00.000Z	ells	tritium	kind of pissed ya know
2005-03-24T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I wish I was around to help you.  That sounds like you just needed some help configuring xserver-xorg
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I agree
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you know that yesterday there was a kernel bug for a few hours that prevented loading of nvidia and other modules?
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	it was only temporary, and got fixed by today
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	ells	tritium	that was it
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	that was temporary :(
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	ells	tritium	again, you are the man, I can reload hoary then
2005-03-24T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you could have booted into one of your old kernel until it was fixed!
2005-03-24T12:13:00.000Z	tritium	ells	no, you're not
2005-03-24T12:13:00.000Z	ells	tritium	just kidding

2005-03-24T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	ells	it's entirely up to you at this point

2005-03-24T12:14:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I think I will, I like the netapplet
2005-03-24T12:15:00.000Z	tritium	ells	if you end up downloading and installing from the preview release CD, you could try it on the desktop too ;)
2005-03-24T12:15:00.000Z	ells	tritium	well it always worked until those updates, ya know the auto ones
2005-03-24T12:16:00.000Z	ells	tritium	Like I said, I even tried debian, but it would not recognize my wireless card
2005-03-24T12:16:00.000Z	tritium	ells	yes.  I had the same problem.  I just booted into an older kernel until it was fixed.  I would have encouraged you to do the same :(
2005-03-24T12:16:00.000Z	ells	tritium	let me ask you, is an ath0 wireless chipset supported in 2.4

2005-03-25T11:41:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I cant beleive I was able to do it in such a short time
2005-03-25T11:14:00.000Z	tritium	ells	what's going on?
2005-03-25T11:15:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I cannot connect thru gftp today
2005-03-25T11:15:00.000Z	tritium	ells	to your desktop?  through ssh?
2005-03-25T11:15:00.000Z	ells	tritium	what in the heck it worked last night, ssh to desktop
2005-03-25T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	ells	does your desktop get its IP address via dhcp?  has its IP changed?
2005-03-25T11:17:00.000Z	ells	tritium	here is what gftp says Error: Could not read from socket: Connection reset by peer
2005-03-25T11:17:00.000Z	tritium	ells	check your desktop's IP address.
2005-03-25T11:17:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I do get it from DHCP
2005-03-25T11:17:00.000Z	ells	tritium	okay
2005-03-25T11:18:00.000Z	tritium	ells	dhcp is not what you want if you're going to setup port forwarding.  Give your desktop a static IP address
2005-03-25T11:19:00.000Z	ells	tritium	okay, but the ip is the same, how can I check this one out
2005-03-26T10:27:00.000Z	ells	tritium	mike what is up. jsgotangco: hoary

2005-04-07T12:24:00.000Z	ells	tritium	how can I do that
2005-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	tritium	ells	System->Preferences->Sound will toggle the setting for future sessions, but you'll have to kill the currently running esd

2005-04-16T16:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I think I asked you before,didnt I
2005-04-16T16:39:00.000Z	tritium	ells	yeah, is it a data DVD, or a movie?
2005-04-16T16:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	movie
2005-04-16T16:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	uncompressed, 8.5 gig
2005-04-16T16:39:00.000Z	tritium	ells	and you looked at transcode?
2005-04-16T16:39:00.000Z	ells	tritium	not sure exactly how to use it
2005-04-16T16:40:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I've not used it, really
2005-04-16T16:40:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I tried dvd shrink again, ,keep getting the ASPI error
2005-04-16T16:41:00.000Z	tritium	ells	look into dvdrip
2005-04-16T16:41:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeah, but it doesnt make the movies copyable to anothre dvd I think
2005-04-16T16:42:00.000Z	tritium	ells	it should...it uses transcode
2005-04-16T16:42:00.000Z	ells	tritium	that is the one that makes it into an .avi right
2005-04-16T16:43:00.000Z	tritium	ells	transcode can convert into several formats
2005-04-16T16:43:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I think that is the one for me, that would not let me compress on the fly
2005-04-16T16:43:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeah mIke, ,and when I went back had the issue of compression. will try again though
2005-04-16T16:43:00.000Z	tritium	ells	ok
2005-04-16T16:44:00.000Z	ells	tritium	see you in a bit Mike
2005-04-16T16:44:00.000Z	tritium	ells	ok
2005-04-16T05:30:00.000Z	tritium	ells	probably not
2005-04-16T05:34:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'm only seeing one, and it's in Marillat's repo
2005-04-16T11:56:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I have been trying to get the dvd copied with no real luck
2005-04-16T11:57:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I tried making an iso and then go in to dvd shrink. I tried backing up the dvd and makine an .img file. Tired of messing with it
2005-04-16T11:57:00.000Z	tritium	ells	sorry to hear you're having trouble
2005-04-16T11:57:00.000Z	ells	tritium	just tired of messing with it
2005-04-16T11:58:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I guess, this will be one thing I will keep windows for
2005-04-16T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	ells	that's too bad it's not working for you.  What's the problem exactly?
2005-04-16T11:58:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I cannot make an exact compressed copy of a dvd
2005-04-16T11:59:00.000Z	ells	tritium	to fit on a 4.7g dvd
2005-04-16T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	ells	what do you mean by exact?  lossless compression?
2005-04-16T11:59:00.000Z	ells	tritium	trying to make more or less a backup of a dvd. the dvd when backed up is more like 6-8 gig
2005-04-16T12:00:00.000Z	ells	tritium	that is why I need to compress it to fit a 4.7 gig dvd
2005-04-16T12:00:00.000Z	tritium	ells	it'll likely by lossy
2005-04-16T12:01:00.000Z	ells	tritium	what ya mean
2005-04-16T12:01:00.000Z	tritium	ells	lossy, as in some information is lost in the compression process
2005-04-16T12:01:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeap, that would be it
2005-04-16T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	ells	okay, as long as you can tolerate that.  :)
2005-04-16T12:02:00.000Z	ells	tritium	i tried making in iso to compress in dvd shrink, but it said the UDF was bad or something
2005-04-16T12:03:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it is frustrating, but I cannot believe someone has not come up with a solution
2005-04-16T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'll bet we can work out a solution if we put some time into it.  Likely, using dvdrip
2005-04-16T12:05:00.000Z	ells	tritium	If you have time, maybe you can take a look at it, I can send you some URLs
2005-04-16T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'll see what I can found out, sure...
2005-04-16T12:06:00.000Z	ells	tritium	thanks Mike
2005-04-16T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	ells	sure, Steve.
2005-04-16T12:06:00.000Z	ells	tritium	LIke they say, things that take time are usually worth it
2005-04-16T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	ells	yep ;)
2005-04-16T12:07:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I will look on this end
2005-04-16T12:10:00.000Z	tritium	ells	sorry, I got disconnected.
2005-04-16T12:10:00.000Z	ells	tritium	no prob Mike
2005-04-16T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I didn't see your reply.  Have you seen the dvdrip website's documentation?
2005-04-16T12:12:00.000Z	ells	tritium	naw, dont think so
2005-04-16T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	ells	can you take a look at it?  I will too...

2005-04-16T14:00:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I think I figured something out
2005-04-16T14:01:00.000Z	tritium	ells	nice!
2005-04-16T14:01:00.000Z	ells	tritium	i made an iso using k3b
2005-04-16T14:01:00.000Z	ells	tritium	then i opened dvd shrink and the file
2005-04-16T14:01:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'm glad you found a solution
2005-04-16T14:01:00.000Z	ells	tritium	just need to figure out how to shrink it down far enough
2005-04-16T14:05:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I'm off to bed.
2005-04-16T14:26:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I think I got it, will see really quick
2005-04-17T09:01:00.000Z	ells	tritium	hey Mike
2005-04-17T09:02:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I tried compressing the iso I made, but it would not let me compress it below 94 percent or so
2005-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you may not be able to compress it any more
2005-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it wont go far enough to put it on a 4.7g dvd
2005-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	ells	tritium	It will go down to about 6.7 gig
2005-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	ells	tritium	hey Mike what is up
2005-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	tritium	ells	Hi Steve - just working hard.  You?
2005-04-18T08:21:00.000Z	ells	tritium	just hangin out, took the kids to soccer practice
2005-04-19T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	ells	hey there.
2005-04-19T10:19:00.000Z	ells	tritium	hey Mike
2005-04-19T10:19:00.000Z	ells	tritium	got my dvd burner today
2005-04-19T10:19:00.000Z	ells	tritium	whats the answer Mike
2005-04-19T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	ells	nice.  What's the device? /dev/hdb ?
2005-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	tritium	ells	sudo hdparm -d 1 /dev/hdb, if so
2005-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	ells	tritium	will that affect it for now on, or just this session
2005-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	tritium	ells	just for now
2005-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	ells	tritium	can I make it for all the time
2005-04-19T10:21:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you can try to enable it in /etc/hdparm.conf, but sometimes the modules are not loaded yet when /etc/init.d/hdparm is called, so it doesn't work for cdroms
2005-04-19T10:21:00.000Z	ells	tritium	you know mike the dvd does not show in the fstab, but it auto loads
2005-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you'd have to add it to the fstab
2005-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	ells	tritium	can you help with the syntax
2005-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	tritium	ells	yes.
2005-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	ells	tritium	cool Mike
2005-04-19T10:49:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I am slowly getting the components I need for this desktop, lastly, need a good video card
2005-04-19T10:49:00.000Z	tritium	ells	that's awesome
2005-04-19T10:49:00.000Z	ells	tritium	nice having this dvd burner
2005-04-19T10:49:00.000Z	ells	tritium	54 bucks, that is a steal
2005-04-19T10:50:00.000Z	tritium	ells	is that still avaiable?
2005-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	tritium	ells	Hi Steve.  Not much.  You?
2005-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	ells	tritium	not alot man
2005-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	ells	tritium	do you know much about video cards
2005-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	tritium	ells	yes.  Well, nVidia, not ATI.
2005-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeah, just trying to see what I really should be looking for, the ram or clock speed
2005-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	ells	tritium	that and the manufacturer
2005-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	tritium	ells	you mean you're considering purchasing one?
2005-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	ells	tritium	yeah, I got the onboard video on my desktop I built
2005-04-22T10:04:00.000Z	ells	tritium	MIke, how fast does your laptop boot up
2005-04-22T10:04:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I haven't timed it, but probably around 20 seconds into gdm
2005-04-22T10:04:00.000Z	ells	tritium	does yours lag on wifi
2005-04-22T10:04:00.000Z	tritium	ells	no, works well
2005-04-22T10:05:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it lags when it comes to the network interfaces
2005-04-22T10:06:00.000Z	ells	tritium	any idea of how I can accelerate my boot up
2005-04-22T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	ells	not beyond what Hoary already does.  That's about the fastest booting distro.
2005-04-22T10:07:00.000Z	ells	tritium	cool
2005-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	ells	tritium	what is up Mike

2005-04-22T12:48:00.000Z	tritium	ells	what kind of data is in the .iso?
2005-04-22T13:08:00.000Z	ells	tritium	Mike, I finally found a website that addresses my dvd issue

2005-05-18T05:21:00.000Z	tritium	ells	okay
2005-05-18T05:22:00.000Z	ells	tritium	what is this,   *** libdvdread: CHECK_VALUE failed in ifo_read.c:1416 ***
2005-05-18T05:23:00.000Z	tritium	ells	looks like a failure to read a dvd properly (number of vobs apparently not read correctly, or something)
2005-05-18T05:24:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it is a dvd I am ripping
2005-05-18T05:24:00.000Z	ells	tritium	do you want to see the syntax I am using
2005-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	tritium	ells	it only happens with this particular dvd?
2005-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	ells	tritium	seems to be with the last two I am doing this too
2005-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	ells	tritium	I think my syntax is wrong
2005-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	tritium	ells	I know next to nothing about dvd ripping, but you can paste
2005-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	ells	tritium	cool, tccat -d 0 -i /dev/dvd -t dvd -P 1 > ~/DVD_Temp/decryp.vob
2005-05-18T05:27:00.000Z	tritium	ells	no idea
2005-05-18T05:28:00.000Z	ells	tritium	it says this, then copies the file
2005-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	ells	tritium	Mike, what is up
2005-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	tritium	ells	hi Steve.  what's new?
