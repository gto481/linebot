2005-04-04T16:55:00.000Z	corza	nis	its fine :)
2005-04-04T16:26:00.000Z	nis	corza	yes. thanks.
2005-04-04T16:26:00.000Z	nis	corza	well now try xvidtune to do the same thing.
2005-04-04T16:27:00.000Z	nis	corza	it will also step thru vid modes. but this time it gives metrics.
2005-04-04T16:28:00.000Z	nis	corza	yeah and for good reason. u can fry the CRT easily.
2005-04-04T16:28:00.000Z	nis	corza	yes it will.
2005-04-04T16:28:00.000Z	nis	corza	you are not.
2005-04-04T16:28:00.000Z	corza	nis	what am i doing?
2005-04-04T16:28:00.000Z	nis	corza	drag the okay window a bit to one side.
2005-04-04T16:29:00.000Z	nis	corza	use the titlebar to do so.
2005-04-04T16:29:00.000Z	nis	corza	the okay window obscures the main interface to xvidtune.
2005-04-04T16:29:00.000Z	nis	corza	that is INTENTIONAL.
2005-04-04T16:29:00.000Z	nis	corza	they knew this day would come. ;)
2005-04-04T16:30:00.000Z	nis	corza	until you press that OK you cannot fry the CRT.
2005-04-04T16:30:00.000Z	nis	corza	and it will fry.  it really will. fire extinguisher time and such.
2005-04-04T16:31:00.000Z	corza	nis	OH I GOT IT THE okay window..
2005-04-04T16:31:00.000Z	corza	nis	lol ok its to the side what do i do?
2005-04-04T16:32:00.000Z	nis	corza	that obscuring window pops up on top of the main xvidtune interface, each and every time you start it.  you can quit xvidtune from the popup. the one obsuring the danger will robinson section.
2005-04-04T16:32:00.000Z	nis	corza	just study it.
2005-04-04T16:33:00.000Z	corza	nis	okay...?
2005-04-04T16:33:00.000Z	corza	nis	vertical sync says 60 still
2005-04-04T16:33:00.000Z	nis	corza	take your time and absorb what's there.  it's all your vid timings.  this is the core of your 60Hz limitation.
2005-04-04T16:34:00.000Z	corza	nis	uh-huh :S
2005-04-04T16:34:00.000Z	nis	corza	you can take a common table fan and set it in front of the display. view the display thru the spinning fan blades.
2005-04-04T16:34:00.000Z	nis	corza	you will be able to see the refresh rate directly.
2005-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	corza	nis	i dont have a table fan
2005-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	nis	corza	I can see 60hz refresh without the fan. ;)
2005-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	corza	nis	oh how true lol
2005-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	nis	corza	averted vision usually.
2005-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	corza	nis	ok so what actually am i doing
2005-04-04T16:36:00.000Z	nis	corza	however, the main thing here is to quit xvidtune, go into one of those other vid modes we saw, and examine xvidtune again.
2005-04-04T16:36:00.000Z	nis	corza	so.  1. quit xvidtune.  2. ctrl alt +   3. xvidtune (and iterate -- repeat -- the sequence 1. 2. 3.)
2005-04-04T16:48:00.000Z	nis	corza	thanks. ;)
2005-04-04T16:48:00.000Z	corza	nis	no prob lol u sent me to restart my computer.. i didnt know how to get out of fullscreen terminal oh ok
2005-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	corza	nis	ok now.. argh i dont know if its worth bothering..
2005-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	nis	corza	it's worth bothering for but it's kinda hard to do interactively at ur skill lvl.
2005-04-04T16:50:00.000Z	corza	nis	if u didnt get the guist then i got it :0
2005-04-04T16:51:00.000Z	corza	nis	onto my second chore.. need to get my 5 mouse buttons working
2005-04-04T16:51:00.000Z	nis	corza	oof.
2005-04-04T16:52:00.000Z	nis	corza	I need a refresher of the overview of what brought you here.  What was main issue?
2005-04-04T16:52:00.000Z	corza	nis	its mainly just the back forward and middle button
2005-04-04T16:53:00.000Z	nis	corza	no the 60 hz problem. btw there's an easy way to map the keyboard to mouse buttons in /etc/sysctl.conf.
2005-04-04T16:54:00.000Z	nis	corza	well on powerpc anyway, there is. ;)
2005-04-04T16:54:00.000Z	corza	nis	umm no i fixed the 60hz problem i'm at 85hz now :)
2005-04-04T16:55:00.000Z	nis	corza	does the display function well for u now at 85 hz? correct resolution etc?
2005-04-04T16:55:00.000Z	corza	nis	just giong to try and fix my mouse buttons
2005-04-04T16:56:00.000Z	nis	corza	good! mouse not too bad.
2005-04-04T16:56:00.000Z	nis	corza	lemee see.
2005-04-04T16:57:00.000Z	corza	nis	k k
2005-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	nis	corza	briefly, you 'Emulate3Buttons' (true) and also 'ZAxisMapping' (4 5).  That's XFree tho.
2005-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	corza	nis	where is this in?
2005-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	nis	corza	that should .. um .. give u at least one more mouse button than u have now. ;)
2005-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	nis	corza	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-04T05:01:00.000Z	nis	corza	the main thing is the test phase.  It's best (IMO) to stop the display manager (xdm, gdm) first, and use startx from the console to troubleshoot xorg.conf.
2005-04-04T05:02:00.000Z	corza	nis	oook.. umm so instead of 4 5 i put true?
2005-04-04T05:03:00.000Z	corza	nis	argh i forget how to gedit a file..
2005-04-04T05:03:00.000Z	nis	corza	depends.  first of all this is xorg not Xfree.  2nd I dunno if the mouse options are same in both.
2005-04-04T05:04:00.000Z	nis	corza	third, u generally enclose with quotations in this part of xorg.conf/XF86Config-4.  I used my old XF86Config-4 with xorg here. ;)
2005-04-04T05:04:00.000Z	nis	corza	sudo
2005-04-04T05:05:00.000Z	corza	nis	i'm in root
2005-04-04T05:05:00.000Z	nis	corza	easier. there's an example xorg.conf in my gentoo. let me look there.
2005-04-04T05:06:00.000Z	corza	nis	hey i found a site that i can use for the codes
2005-04-04T05:07:00.000Z	corza	nis	how do u get into gedit to edit a file in terminal with root?
2005-04-04T05:07:00.000Z	nis	corza	the terminal /launches/ gedit, a GUI editor
2005-04-04T05:20:00.000Z	corza	nis	did u end up finding anything?
2005-04-04T05:20:00.000Z	nis	corza	I'm burned out and snowed in and hungry.  I didn't look. ;)
2005-04-04T05:21:00.000Z	corza	nis	lol
