2008-03-07T21:00:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	first. install wacom-tools from the repos
2008-03-07T21:01:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Now let's edit your xorg/conf file.
2008-03-07T21:02:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	You have your xorg.conf file open?
2008-03-07T21:02:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	ok
2008-03-07T21:02:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	yes
2008-03-07T21:02:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Near the bottom do you see three lines simialr to this:
2008-03-07T21:03:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	yes i see
2008-03-07T21:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Uncomment them: stylus, cursor, and earaser
2008-03-07T21:03:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	done now
2008-03-07T21:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	note do not uncomment this line:
2008-03-07T21:04:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	no i did't
2008-03-07T21:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	:)
2008-03-07T21:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Do you have three InputDevice Sections: stylus, cursor, and eraeser ?
2008-03-07T21:05:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	And does your stylus have a right-click button?
2008-03-07T21:05:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	yes
2008-03-07T21:06:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Ok. Then add this option to the stylus and eraser section only:
2008-03-07T21:08:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Do you want to be able to rotate your display when in tablet mode? or just leave it?
2008-03-07T21:09:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	just leave it
2008-03-07T21:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Are you sure? Autorotation is nice...
2008-03-07T21:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	It only takes one more line in you xorg.conf....
2008-03-07T21:09:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	how it exatly wotks?
2008-03-07T21:11:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	When you go into tablet mode, the display will rotate 90 degrees or 180 degrees if you like. when you put the lid back up, it roates back to laptop mode. As I siad, you will only need one line in your xorg file and a script, which I'll provide you
2008-03-07T21:11:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	hmm let's try it :) if i don't like it i can allways disable it
2008-03-07T21:11:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Sounds good! Now in your Section "Screen" add this line:
2008-03-07T21:13:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	done
2008-03-07T21:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Save and close your xorg file
2008-03-07T21:14:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	done
2008-03-07T21:14:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	next?
2008-03-07T21:15:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Open a text editor and copy and paste the following into a new file. Save it as ~/.auto-rotate http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58747/
2008-03-07T21:16:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Note. you do not need the line numbering (i'm sure you knew that. just like to make sure)
2008-03-07T21:16:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	ok
2008-03-07T21:17:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Make it executable: chmod +x ~/.auto-rotate
2008-03-07T21:17:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	next
2008-03-07T21:18:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Using gnome, kde, or xfce, or other?
2008-03-07T21:18:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	gnome
2008-03-07T21:20:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Add the script to start up: System --> Pref --> Sessions. In the start up programs tab. select new. Name: Auto-rotate Command: Browse to the auto-rorate script
2008-03-07T21:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Oh, i forgot to add. Did you see line 51-53 in the script. Uncomment the display you would like to use in tablet mode, right, left, or inverted. But only use one at a time.
2008-03-07T21:23:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	ok
2008-03-07T21:25:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	Now restart X and hope that every things works. try the stylus, try rightclicking and try rotateing the display. Report back.
2008-03-07T21:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	How did it go?
2008-03-07T21:33:00.000Z	overlow	Odd-rationale	 it doesn't still work

2008-03-07T22:55:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	You might want to uninstall wacom-tools before starting the guide.
2008-03-07T22:56:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	overlow	As the guide requires you to compile the newest wacom-tools from source.
