2009-12-19T17:14:00.000Z	klumpen		Is there a problem with NFS in karmic? It worked perfect in jaunty, but after upgrade it stopped working
2009-12-19T17:14:00.000Z	klumpen		100% sure that export file is correct
2009-12-19T17:14:00.000Z	klumpen		cant even connect from loopback interface
2009-12-19T17:14:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	any useful errors found?
2009-12-19T17:15:00.000Z	klumpen		refused mount request from 127.0.0.1
2009-12-19T17:15:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	firewall blocking ports?
2009-12-19T17:15:00.000Z	klumpen		 unmatched host
2009-12-19T17:15:00.000Z	klumpen		nop
2009-12-19T17:15:00.000Z	klumpen		can see errormessage in syslog
2009-12-19T17:15:00.000Z	klumpen		so it makes the connection
2009-12-19T17:16:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	conflicting entries in /etc/hosts.allow hosts.deny?
2009-12-19T17:17:00.000Z	klumpen		allow: ALL : 127.0.0.1
2009-12-19T17:17:00.000Z	klumpen		nothing in hosts.deny config
2009-12-19T17:17:00.000Z	klumpen		clean file
2009-12-19T17:19:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	what nfs server is installed? the nfs-kernel-server?
2009-12-19T17:19:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	jep
2009-12-19T17:19:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	i'm on fresh 9.10 install with nfs-kernel-server and no problems for localhost
2009-12-19T17:20:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	guess it is something outside nfs config
2009-12-19T17:20:00.000Z	klumpen		this is a upgraded version, and it worked before i upgraded
2009-12-19T17:20:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	ran exportfs -a ?
2009-12-19T17:20:00.000Z	klumpen		jep
2009-12-19T17:20:00.000Z	klumpen		and checked portmap
2009-12-19T17:20:00.000Z	klumpen		it should be correct
2009-12-19T17:21:00.000Z	klumpen		have follow typ 100 howto guides now I think, but it still not works
2009-12-19T17:22:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	I'm  not sure what exactly gives the "unmatched host"
2009-12-19T17:23:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	since it mountd that gives the errormessage i guess it think that the host do not match in te export config
2009-12-19T17:25:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	in that case, the error msg should be followed (i think) by a line like : "request from unknown host x.x.x.x for /share"
2009-12-19T17:26:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	really? portmap that gives this errormessage you think?
2009-12-19T17:27:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	still not sure. Is there an error entry like "request from unknown host" ?
2009-12-19T17:27:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	also: can you ping localhost by name?
2009-12-19T17:28:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	no error with that name, and yes, i can ping localhost by name
2009-12-19T17:30:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	that's one weird case of nfs :(
2009-12-19T17:31:00.000Z	klumpen		mm
2009-12-19T17:31:00.000Z	klumpen		run NFS on many servers at work
2009-12-19T17:31:00.000Z	klumpen		and it works perfec
2009-12-19T17:31:00.000Z	klumpen		use samba at home, but it soo slow :(
2009-12-19T17:31:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	yes, i know. All the basics seem in place and correct.
2009-12-19T17:32:00.000Z	klumpen		network file system
2009-12-19T17:32:00.000Z	oCean_		!nfs | Tek-5-8-6
2009-12-19T17:32:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	anyway, thanks for your help :)
2009-12-19T17:33:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	sure, no prob.
2009-12-19T17:39:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	just another tought: when "tcpdump" is installed, it would help determine which ip is actually performing the mount request
2009-12-19T17:43:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	great tip, and yes, it tries to connect
2009-12-19T17:44:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	so, you should be seeing something like "IP localhost.nfs > localhost.3187409403: reply ok"
2009-12-19T17:45:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	yes, a lot of entrys
2009-12-19T17:48:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	to filter NFS only: "tcpdump -i lo port 2049"  (when using loopback=lo) - still if the incoming requests are translated as coming from "localhost", then that entry in exports should be correct, and not render "unmatched host"
2009-12-19T17:56:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	with those filters nothing come up
2009-12-19T17:57:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	what does "sudo netstat -anp | grep 2049"  output?
2009-12-19T17:58:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2049            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
2009-12-19T18:00:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	that's correct, listening on all interfaces. The tcpdump might not return anything when your loopback is no "lo", see ifconfig -a | grep -i loopback
2009-12-19T18:01:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
2009-12-19T18:02:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	ok, your loopback *is* lo, so I would think the tcpdump should return the NFS traffic/requests. Not sure why that's not the case
2009-12-19T18:02:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	is it possible that portmap is stopping the connection?
2009-12-19T18:03:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	yes. "service portmap status" should return running PID
2009-12-19T18:03:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	portmap start/running, process 17806
2009-12-19T18:03:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	using "sudo netstat -anp |grep PID_OF_PORTMAP" should show whether it's really listening
2009-12-19T18:03:00.000Z	klumpen		tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:111             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      17806/portmap
2009-12-19T18:04:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	in that case, re-run tcpdump, using port 111, like "tcpdump -i lo port 111" and re-try the nfs mount
2009-12-19T18:04:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	just to be sure: leave tcpdump running, and remount in another window..
2009-12-19T18:04:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	14:02:53.205459 IP localhost.58950 > localhost.sunrpc: Flags [.], ack 34, win 513, options [nop,nop,TS val 692053065 ecr 692053065], length 0
2009-12-19T18:05:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	so it makes the connection
2009-12-19T18:05:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	aha, so the requests talk to portmap.
2009-12-19T18:05:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	indeed
2009-12-19T18:05:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	what does "grep match /var/log/daemon.log" show?
2009-12-19T18:05:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	efused mount request from 127.0.0.1 for /home/klumpen (/home/klumpen): unmatched host
2009-12-19T18:06:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	are you completely sure /etc/exports is correct? No typo's ?
2009-12-19T18:06:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	/home/klumpen/ 127.0.0.1 (rw,async)
2009-12-19T18:06:00.000Z	oCean_		!br | Guest10679
2009-12-19T18:08:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	can't get more basic than that :)
2009-12-19T18:08:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	mm, so i dont understand why it does not work. is should be soo easy! :p
2009-12-19T18:08:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	I'm out of options.. seems all fine to me.
2009-12-19T18:09:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	one more thing. Does "sudo exportfs -a" output anything useful?
2009-12-19T18:09:00.000Z	klumpen		nothing
2009-12-19T18:10:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	no output
2009-12-19T18:10:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	oh, and also: what does "exportfs" show?
2009-12-19T18:10:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	nothing. should that give me a output?
2009-12-19T18:11:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	yes, that should output which filesystems are exported, to which host(s)
2009-12-19T18:11:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	the exportfs might be off somewhere
2009-12-19T18:11:00.000Z	klumpen		hm
2009-12-19T18:11:00.000Z	klumpen		have exportfs a debug function?
2009-12-19T18:12:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	-v will make it more verbose
2009-12-19T18:12:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	no output at all
2009-12-19T18:13:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	nothing in syslog nether
2009-12-19T18:14:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	you are really sure you edited "/etc/exports" file? (to add the exported filesystem?) One more thing you could do, since all else fails: remove nfs-kernel-server & reinstall
2009-12-19T18:14:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	cat /etc/export
2009-12-19T18:14:00.000Z	klumpen		/home/klumpen/ 127.0.0.1 (rw,async)
2009-12-19T18:14:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	aha
2009-12-19T18:14:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	it is /etc/exports
2009-12-19T18:15:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	add the s, and you'll be home
2009-12-19T18:15:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	omg :(
2009-12-19T18:15:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	haha, it's one of those days i guess
2009-12-19T18:16:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	haha, cant belive it. I have debugged this shit 4 weeks now
2009-12-19T18:17:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	works like a charm now!
2009-12-19T18:17:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	great! Enjoy :)
2009-12-19T18:17:00.000Z	klumpen	oCean_	thanks for all your help
2009-12-19T18:17:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	sure
2009-12-19T18:18:00.000Z	oCean_	klumpen	have to go anyway, glad we made it. :)
