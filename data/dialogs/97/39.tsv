2007-04-08T09:48:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	no, i will try this and possibly get back with you, thanks.
2007-04-08T09:49:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	no problem

2007-04-08T09:53:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	uname -a i think
2007-04-08T09:53:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	uname -r
2007-04-08T10:02:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	no, that didn't work my xserver crashed again
2007-04-08T10:02:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	pastebin a copy of your Xorg log
2007-04-08T10:03:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	it should be in /var/log under Xorg.0.log i think
2007-04-08T10:04:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14509/
2007-04-08T10:04:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	one second
2007-04-08T10:06:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	have you removed envy then tried to reconfigure x?
2007-04-08T10:06:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	no, ive not
2007-04-08T10:06:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	remove envy and try to reconfigure again..
2007-04-08T10:08:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	would envy not allow me to change my video drivers or something?
2007-04-08T10:08:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	i dont know, but it cant help if it already screwed ur x up
2007-04-08T10:08:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	doesnt hurt to get rid of what caused the problem in the 1st place
2007-04-08T10:09:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	what is sad is that i had already set up all my drivers, but i got a new monitor and i thought envy could possibly fix my resolution problems.
2007-04-08T10:09:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	what driver were you using before you installed envy, and what was wrong with ur resolution
2007-04-08T10:09:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	but sense im quite new  wasn't sure what i was doing
2007-04-08T10:10:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	totally feel u dude, i borked ubuntu so many times before getting it right lol
2007-04-08T10:10:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	i was using some nvidia driver i got from the site awhile ago, but my old monitor died that was running 1600x1200
2007-04-08T10:10:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	whats wrong with 1024x768? lol
2007-04-08T10:11:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	i hate it. i love to have tons of space
2007-04-08T10:11:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	ah, well sometimes we have to settle for the best we can get
2007-04-08T10:11:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	yea, but this makes windows look like a joke, it was total trash.
2007-04-08T10:12:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	try wut i suggested..maybe envy is still messing with your drivers in some way
2007-04-08T10:12:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	well i know this monitor can handle these upper resolutions, thats why it was bothering me
2007-04-08T10:12:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	kk
2007-04-08T10:12:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	should i try reinstalling the drivers, or just restart x?
2007-04-08T10:13:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	remove envy, reconfigure X, then restart
2007-04-08T10:22:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	well i reinstalled my video drivers, and restarted x, but my xorg.config is still set on vesa drivers, what is the command to reconfigure xorg.conf?
2007-04-08T10:22:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-04-08T10:25:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	you sir are the man.
2007-04-08T10:25:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	:) no problem brah

2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	do u have the resolution u want?
2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	now help me fix my resolution
2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	u can try to manually add the resolution u want to xorg.conf and then restart X
2007-04-08T10:26:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	its finally running at 75 hertz now, while it was running at 50
2007-04-08T10:27:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	modes  "1600x1200"  -_-
2007-04-08T10:27:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	its already in there?
2007-04-08T10:28:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	this monitor could push that res in winxp... sheitttttt
2007-04-08T10:28:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	not sure wut to tell you dude, just settle with a lower res on ubuntu or a higher one on winblows,, your choise
2007-04-08T10:29:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	WEAKSAUCE!
2007-04-08T10:29:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	have u tried manually editing the xorg.conf?
2007-04-08T10:30:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	yea ive tried tons of things, next i am going to make the monitor generic and try to push it
2007-04-08T10:30:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	because atm i think the hor/vertical sync is too low
2007-04-08T10:31:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	that could be it, just try tweaking the xorg.conf a bit, u may have some luck, dont forget to backup first
2007-04-08T10:44:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	this is depressing
2007-04-08T10:44:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	lol

2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	it sounds like ur stuck @ 1024X768 lol
2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	mindblock	zYe	its not that bad youll get used to it, ive never ran at a higher res than that, and im fine
2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	so far ive got it to, 1280x906

2007-04-08T10:51:00.000Z	zYe	mindblock	yea that shouldn't be so hard to figure out, all i know is envy is a piece of shit.
