2006-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	you need to install xmodmap and xbindkeys
2006-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	Snake	ladydoor	thank you
2006-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	xmodmap will allow you to remap your keys, and xbindkeys will allow you to assign a key to a program
2006-08-31T10:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	and if you need any help, feel free to ask
2006-08-31T10:06:00.000Z	Snake	ladydoor	well its already assigned with the "keyboard shortcuts" but it trys to launch rythembox, rather than amarok
2006-08-31T10:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	aha...you need to edit that keyboard shortcut so that it'll specifically use amarok instead of "music-player" or whatever
2006-08-31T10:08:00.000Z	Snake	ladydoor	amarok
2006-08-31T10:11:00.000Z	Snake	ladydoor	im sorry to bug you, but can you explain to me exactly what I need to do with xmodmap? This man page is terriable
2006-08-31T10:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	you're not bugging me
2006-08-31T10:11:00.000Z	Snake	ladydoor	would it be like xmodmap -e shift_r = Backspace or something?
2006-08-31T10:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	what keys are you trying to remap? (first open .Xmodmap in your favorite text editor)
2006-08-31T10:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	it's better to use a .Xmodmap file
2006-08-31T10:12:00.000Z	Snake	ladydoor	where is that located
2006-08-31T10:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	Snake	in your home dir. it might not exist yet :-)
