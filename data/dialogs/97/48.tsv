2006-12-05T06:20:00.000Z	scrupul0us		im having issues with mysql on a fresh install of edgy.. when i added new users via phpmyadmin they cant login... the ONLY account that CAN login is root... not even the account i made during install... please help
2006-12-05T06:21:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	mysql users are not the same as your system's users...
2006-12-05T06:22:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	i added new users underphpmyadmin.. and they cant login via phpmyadmin
2006-12-05T06:24:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	and the users you added have priveleges on localhost?
2006-12-05T06:25:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	i event went so low as %
2006-12-05T06:26:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	and you flushed the priveleges?
2006-12-05T06:26:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	yessir
2006-12-05T06:27:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	i even reloaded mysql
2006-12-05T06:27:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	/etc/init.d/mysql restart
2006-12-05T06:28:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	what error do you get if you try to log in via command line client?
2006-12-05T06:29:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	may i message you
2006-12-05T06:29:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	if you keep it in channel then anyone can help or learn. I'm no mysql guru :)
2006-12-05T06:30:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	mysql -u blog -p
2006-12-05T06:30:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'blog'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
2006-12-05T06:31:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	here is copy/paste from phpmyadmin... "blog   localhost   Yes    ALL PRIVILEGES  "
2006-12-05T06:31:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	thats the privledges tab
2006-12-05T06:34:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	do mysql users have to be system users as well?
2006-12-05T06:34:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	caus this si crazy
2006-12-05T06:34:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	no - mysql users have nothing to do with system users
2006-12-05T06:35:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	thats what i thought.. but i cant for the life of me think why it doesnt work
2006-12-05T06:36:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	and logging in as "-u root" works?
2006-12-05T06:36:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i'll need to scratch my head about this one for a moment...
2006-12-05T06:37:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	im righnt there with you
2006-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	before we go any further (and sorry to ask this...), you're sure you have the passwords correct (including case etc)?
2006-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	yes i just reset them on the one users ive been trying to add... twice... no go
2006-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	simple test/test
2006-12-05T06:42:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	well i just got in after i flushed
2006-12-05T06:42:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	any good with squirrelmail? thats next on my hotlist :)
2006-12-05T06:45:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	yeah, i'm running squirrelmail. I set it up about 2 years ago though... :)
2006-12-05T06:45:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	as i mentioned im on a fresh install of edgy... i have SM installed but it keeps telling me my imap server dropped the connection when i try to login
2006-12-05T06:46:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	and i cannot find ANYTHING to help fix it
2006-12-05T06:46:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i think you need to delete the old indexes
2006-12-05T06:47:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	old... its a fresh install... shouldnt be any old about it... never-thepless whats involved there
2006-12-05T06:47:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	you are using it toi access mail on your own server?
2006-12-05T06:47:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	yes
2006-12-05T06:47:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	do you have any important mail stored yet? If so back it up first...
2006-12-05T06:48:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	ive got nothing on there
2006-12-05T06:48:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i'm remembering this from a looong time ago...
2006-12-05T06:48:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	im configured like this: http://howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p5
2006-12-05T06:48:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	in your Mail folder, try "rm -rf .imap/"
2006-12-05T06:48:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	for post fix and courier
2006-12-05T06:49:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	why is that
2006-12-05T06:50:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	it will delete the indexes which may be causing the connection to drop. Ihad this problem once and that fixed it
2006-12-05T06:50:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	but i'm afraid it is a "worksforme"
2006-12-05T06:50:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	back the directory up first, if you're worried
2006-12-05T06:51:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	i mean locate
2006-12-05T06:52:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i'm using dovecot as the server. Maybe that is the difference?
2006-12-05T06:52:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	idk i tried that b4 as well...apt-get install dovecot.. still didnt work after i updated the squirrlmail-configure
2006-12-05T06:53:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	what does "ls -a ~/Mail" reveal?
2006-12-05T06:54:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	ls: /root/Mail: No such file or directory
2006-12-05T06:55:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	do you have any mail directory in your user's home dir (not root)
2006-12-05T06:56:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	i have one other users (my non-root account) and no.. theres no mail folder under its home dir
2006-12-05T06:58:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	what error message do you get in /var/log/mail.err or /var/log/mail.log?
2006-12-05T06:59:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	Dec  4 02:42:21 web postfix/smtpd[10496] : lost connection after CONNECT from localhost.localdomain[127.0.0.1]

2006-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	that's more like it...
2006-12-05T07:03:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	in /etc/postfix/main.cf i have this set: home_mailbox = Maildir/
2006-12-05T07:03:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	try making a Maildir directory in /root/ and under your user's home dir
2006-12-05T07:05:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	creating Maildir got me in... now i have an error in EVERY pane
2006-12-05T07:05:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	lol
2006-12-05T07:05:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	what are the errors in the logs (pastebin them if more than one line)
2006-12-05T07:06:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	please hold while i create a laughable log file ;)

2006-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	"ls -a /home/youruser/Maildir/"?
2006-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	but the errors are the same
2006-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	is exists but its empty
2006-12-05T07:11:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	you installed squirrelmail and your mail server through apt-get?
2006-12-05T07:11:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	apt-get install postfix libsasl2 sasl2-bin libsasl2-modules libdb3-util procmail
2006-12-05T07:12:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	and squirrelmail?

2006-12-05T07:12:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	apt-get squirrelmail
2006-12-05T07:13:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	what are the permissions on /home/user/Maildir?
2006-12-05T07:15:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	drwxr-xr-x 2 scrupul0us scrupul0us
2006-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	 and the left pane now says: ERROR: Connection dropped by IMAP server.
2006-12-05T07:20:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i wonder if your imap server is set up correctly?
2006-12-05T07:20:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	how so sir?
2006-12-05T07:27:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	any ideas?

2006-12-05T07:30:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	actually, INBOX.Sent
2006-12-05T07:31:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	and INBOX.Drafts and INBOX.Trash
2006-12-05T07:33:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	right pane: ERROR: Could not complete request.
2006-12-05T07:34:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i'm sure your sever should be creating this. Never mind. Try mkdir /home/user/Maildir/INBOX
2006-12-05T07:35:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	when i finally DID get it to login before it auto created .Sent in the folder... but thats it
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	what do u recommend i do from here?
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	im not above starting from scratch
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	i just want things to WORK
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	maybe that is a good idea. http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/200 http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/275 are a good start
2006-12-05T07:43:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	i'm afraid i'm too sleepy to think this one out logically :)
2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	doh
2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	you have any other way to get ahold of you besides here?
2006-12-05T07:45:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	not really. I tend to leave irssi running all of the time, so if you use my nick i should find you eventually
2006-12-05T07:46:00.000Z	mcphail	scrupul0us	sorry i couldn't be of more help. Perhaps others in the channel could help you?
2006-12-05T08:17:00.000Z	scrupul0us	mcphail	said that wasnt a good tutorial to follow
