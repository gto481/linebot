2007-05-19T08:25:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 you need to reset grub to read stabe 1 on the boot partition which is (hd0) , hence the grub setup (hdO)
2007-05-19T08:27:00.000Z	ubuntu	Pelo	: Should i reinstall grub
2007-05-19T08:27:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	that would be a good idea

2007-09-10T15:52:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 why not
2007-11-04T04:13:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 there doesn't seem to be anyone in here clear on your problem atm can you start from scratch ?
2007-11-04T04:14:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 is ubuntu actualy installed or are you running the live cd ?
2007-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 ok boot the installed version,  then run  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   if you don't see your card listed , use the vesa driver
2007-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 what is the other card ?
2007-11-04T04:17:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 if you want to install ubuntut on your comp running a ati or nvidia card you better use the alternate install cd, it is a text based installer,  install a vesa driver so you can get running and then you can install proper nvidia or ati drivers fro your card
2007-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 that's pretty much all I can do for you , try the dpkg-reconfigure thing I suggested earlier
2007-11-04T04:19:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	 it's basicaly the same as the ubuntu live cd , but whitout the live cd part or the pretty graphics
2008-04-09T22:26:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	permissions ?
2008-04-09T22:29:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	try it with the command like  sudo rm /path/filename
2008-04-09T22:29:00.000Z	ubuntu	Pelo	: did, says: rm: cannot remove `khfFXooo.dll': Read-only file system
2008-04-09T22:30:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	very odd
2008-04-10T07:18:00.000Z	ubuntu	Pelo	Anything in particular i should do once installed?
2008-04-10T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	yes,  do not do anything , other then try to install the restricted driver from the admin menu, that is the only safe thing to do at this point
2008-04-10T07:20:00.000Z	ubuntu	Pelo	tmi
2008-04-10T07:23:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	for gui apps gksu , for commands sudo

2008-04-10T07:23:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	gksu and gksudo sar the same
2008-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	ubuntu	Pelo	what is the difference between gksudo and normal sudo?
2008-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	read up , gksu is for gtk apps, works a bit differetrnly
2008-04-10T07:25:00.000Z	ubuntu	Pelo	RyanPrior: Can't really read up ATM. I got that one is cli, one is gtk, i was wondering if there was a larger reason under the hood
2008-04-10T07:25:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	there is but it's over my head so I can'T realy explain it
2008-04-10T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu	/nick newnick
