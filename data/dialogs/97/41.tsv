2007-02-26T06:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	if i recall correctly, the only question it asked me, was how many bytes of memory my video card had
2007-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	Shrimpy1	IndyGunFreak	i know i did not want to bother you but i'm going to ask you some
2007-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	if i can remember, i'll try
2007-02-26T06:49:00.000Z	Shrimpy1	IndyGunFreak	it ask for pci bus port would it be 00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 03)    but the 00:02.1 part?
2007-02-26T06:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	you got me on that one, i have no idea.
2007-02-26T07:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	i don't know if i love it that much, but it is at least comedic relief.
2007-02-26T07:01:00.000Z	Shrimpy1	IndyGunFreak	on the configyyy thingyyy it ask for video tingggyyyys   (as in sizes ex 800x600) do i click only one or can i have more then one? and what did you do?
2007-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	honestly, its been ages since i've done that command, i don't remember, but i think i only chose 1
2007-02-26T07:04:00.000Z	Shrimpy1	IndyGunFreak	ok its done do i reboot?
2007-02-26T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	i guess if it tells you to reboot, yes
2007-02-26T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	but listen
2007-02-26T07:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy1	if its screwed up, before you do a new install, boot a live cd, install x-chat or something, and come back here and see if we can help you fix the prob.
2007-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	Shrimpy1	IndyGunFreak	alright! i have my windows desktop that i hardly touch and i'll long on to that.  Thanks for your help hope to talk to you later with a sucess rating!
