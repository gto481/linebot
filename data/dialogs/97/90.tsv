2005-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT		is there any eyecandy channels on this server?
2005-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	general icandy?
2005-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	not really; you should be able to discuss that sort of stuff in your desktop-environment channel
2005-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	yeah
2005-03-31T07:40:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	which one is the  one for gnome?
2005-03-31T07:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	#gnome
2005-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	though, irc.gimp.org #gnome is more active, IIRC.
2005-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	thankx
2005-04-02T16:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	around 550 megs
2005-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	actually, it's probably less; it's quite a bit, but just less than the CD, I believe.
2005-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	then i doubt i can downlaod that with a 56k connexion lol id be here all month
2005-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	yup :).
2005-04-02T16:32:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	you know how hoary right now is in preview what exactly do they mean by preview like it doesnt have full programmes or something?
2005-04-02T16:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	it means that it's still technically in "developement" status. It will reach "stable" status on April; roughly April 6th.
2005-04-02T16:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Though in such a status, the vast majority of people in here are using it. Hoary has all the latest apps etc. Warty will still get security updates for 18 months after its release, but it won't be getting new apps.
2005-04-02T16:37:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	see how jsut because BT( british telecom ) cant be asked to run a 1 mile long cable to the sourronding villages we peope are serously dissadvantaged
2005-04-02T16:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	That certainly sucks. I'm in GB, too. Wherabouts are you? :)
2005-04-02T16:38:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	South you?
2005-04-02T16:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	London :P
2005-04-02T16:38:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	i am around bristol
2005-04-02T16:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Cool; I'm thinking of going to Uni there this year. Nice place.
2005-04-02T16:39:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	how old are you becuase i still have another 4 years to even think about how to spell uni lol
2005-04-02T16:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	18
2005-04-02T16:40:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	gezz take 3 of that thats me i am young hehe
2005-04-02T16:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	minor :D.
2005-04-02T16:41:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	check it out i jsut thoguht of something funny, you know in the matrix how they take the pill and they enter real life well its like here we linux users have escaped the windows empire and are saved
2005-04-02T16:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	released/set free/unleashed. Yes. ;-)
2005-04-02T16:42:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	since when you been linux user
2005-04-02T16:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	just under a year, now.
2005-04-02T16:42:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	i am a total noob when i mean noob i meant it (you can tell)
2005-04-02T16:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	all in good time. :P
2005-04-02T16:43:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	look do you think i should read all the manuals whihc will boar meto death and i wil;l forget 95% of it or shall i stay here and just learn by trial and improvment (what did you do?)
2005-04-02T16:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	It really depends on what manual and what for. I'd recommend a manual/tutorial on the Command Line. It'll make you more confident with it.
2005-04-02T16:45:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	what you mean by command line is like terminals and stuff like cd mkdir rm ls ls -a apt-get etc etc etc?
2005-04-02T16:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Anything in the Terminal, yup.
2005-04-02T16:45:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	is this what you did
2005-04-02T16:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Yup, exactly.
2005-04-02T16:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	It's also worth just skim reading the beggining of the rute manual; it tells you some basic Linux stuff.
2005-04-02T16:47:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	ok i will take that advice another thing are you anygood with fire fox?
2005-04-02T16:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	What's the problem? I don't use it as my default browser.
2005-04-02T16:48:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	i jsut have this thing that whenever i use it it has soem red text at the bottom saying ^ class="t
2005-04-02T16:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Sounds quite dodgy. Have you reported it? Firefox is in MAIN...
2005-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	is in main what/
2005-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Because it's in Main (repository), it's officially supported by Ubuntu. So, you can file a bug... though, have you tried reinstalling?
2005-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	nope i didnt know you could do that ill try
2005-04-02T16:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	yup. Just reinstall from synaptic.
2005-04-02T16:57:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	how many linux distro's you been involved with
2005-04-02T16:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	3 properly; 2 have been a passer-by.
2005-04-02T16:58:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	which ones?
2005-04-02T16:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Properly: Mandrake, Fedora, Ubu. Passer-by: Debian, SuSE.
2005-04-02T16:59:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	i tryed mandrake latest 10.1 but its was really going wrong on me and people told me ubuntu and gentoo was brill so i picked ubuntu
2005-04-03T16:00:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	why did you pass by debian if ubuntu is like a sub debian?
2005-04-03T16:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	It's a good distro. The first one I tried, as it happens. Quite liked it.
2005-04-03T16:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	not so much because I didn't like it. Installed it on another computer while I had Fedora on mine; didn't think of switching at the time.
2005-04-03T16:00:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	geez i trying to close synaptic down but it wont close down ?
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	you can't check the X in the top-right-corner?
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	is there a download currently?
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	nope
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	and if it's not loading anything, then you might want to just kill it
2005-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	there was but then i relized i only had 15 minutes ledt to go to bed i cancled
2005-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	flint@ubuntu:~ $ killall synaptic
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	well, if it's crashed then you're best off killing it.
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	sudo it
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	thanks just learned how to kill a programme cheers
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	you only ever have to sudo if it's being run by root. Synaptic is always thus.
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	ok ill take that onboard too.
2005-04-03T16:05:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	have you ever made your own alterations to a source of a programme to make it do what you required or to change something?
2005-04-03T16:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	a few times; very minor things.
2005-04-03T16:07:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	are you a type of user which has no room for Eyecandy and doesnt like icons on there desktop?
2005-04-03T16:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Quite the opposite. :)
2005-04-03T16:07:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	so you liek eyecandy too >
2005-04-03T16:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	very much so, yes. I like to be looking at something that is aesthetically pleasing.
2005-04-03T16:09:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	i liek eyecandy too vvery much aswell but i dont like icons on desktop. anyway i have put the MAC OSX AQUA theme and a glossed icon theme and i would like the equiv to superkaramaba for gnome( i think is gdesklets )
2005-04-03T16:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	I recommend switching to KDE :P certainly, but that is your decision. Yup, superkaramba is great. I think themes run alright on Gnome, however.
2005-04-03T16:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	I put some screenies up not so long ago: youmortals.com/stuff/ubuntu
2005-04-03T16:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	none with the x composite extentsion there though; should put them up when I next have time.
2005-04-03T16:17:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	do you have kubuntu then?
2005-04-03T16:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	Yeah.
2005-04-03T16:19:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	so i dont know anything about kubuntu but is it only fro hoary or warty i mean is there like warty kubuntu so on...
2005-04-03T16:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	KDE is available on Warty, but only KDE 3.2. Hoary has 3.4 in the repositories (one of the first distros to, FTR).
2005-04-03T16:23:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	FTR meaning ?
2005-04-03T16:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	For The Record
2005-04-03T16:23:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	when do you think i could get hoary from cd?
2005-04-03T16:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	right now. :)
2005-04-03T16:24:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	so what if i order some cd of ubuntu off site there cd will now change form warty t ohoary?
2005-04-03T16:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	oh... to order. I'm not sure if they sell the Hoary arrays.
2005-04-03T16:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	I don't think they do; you'll likely have to wait for the official. April 6th.
2005-04-03T16:25:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	apokryphos	so what where you thinking of ::P
2005-04-03T16:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	Fl-i-nT	downloading the ISO. Momentarily forgot about BT evilness.
