2005-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	are you trying to add something or just update?
2005-12-28T07:01:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I'm just trying to boot
2005-12-28T07:02:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 you mean this happened during initial install of ubuntu?
2005-12-28T07:02:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	no, I've had ubuntu running fabulous for half a year...
2005-12-28T07:03:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  lol  thats what i asked you   did you add someting or upgrade
2005-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 does it boot using recovery
2005-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	how do i use recovery?
2005-12-28T07:07:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 grub menu
2005-12-28T07:07:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I don't have a grub menu, It's ppc
2005-12-28T07:09:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 have you added or removed any hardware lately?
2005-12-28T07:09:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	no... theres not really anything to install on an ibook
2005-12-28T07:09:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  is /home on its own partition?
2005-12-28T07:09:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	no
2005-12-28T07:10:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  you could always use a liveCD to copy off your /home settings
2005-12-28T07:11:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	huh?   it wont boot either?
2005-12-28T07:11:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	what?
2005-12-28T07:11:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  sorry  ::P
2005-12-28T07:32:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	the LiveCDs dont work either
2005-12-28T07:48:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  does fdisk -l   show any partitions?
2005-12-28T07:49:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	the livecd doesn't have the fdisk command
2005-12-28T07:52:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  what directory are you trying to mount it to?
2005-12-28T07:58:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  do you have ANY other liveCDs  say knoppix?
2005-12-28T07:58:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	no I don't...
2005-12-28T08:13:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	my vote goes for having a friend burn you  2 diff liveCDs   say 1-ubuntu and 1-knoppix    then  have a go  before the reinstall wipes it
2005-12-28T08:13:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I have a cd burner
2005-12-28T08:14:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	at least I have my main ubuntu computer, this one.  But my iBook is important whenever I have to go places
2005-12-29T06:56:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  yes  i keep both
2005-12-29T06:57:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	which do you think I should use first?
2005-12-29T06:57:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  whats broken?
2005-12-29T06:57:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	my iBook..
2005-12-29T06:57:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  zero experience with apple products   wich i did
2005-12-29T06:57:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I did a dist-upgrade from breezy to breezy and it got rid of a kernel module or something, then had some hard drive errors on some modules
2005-12-29T06:58:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	and it won't boot at all past calculating module dependencies
2005-12-29T06:58:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	should I use knoppix ?
2005-12-29T06:59:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 sure
2005-12-29T07:00:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  but i think Ubuntu liveCD should be your first choice
2005-12-29T07:00:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	alright, but that corrupted on me randomly a lot...
2005-12-29T07:01:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I wanna try something new anyways... = p  I'll be able to make changes to my hard drive right?  Will I be able to use apt on the hard drive to make changes?
2005-12-29T07:01:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	ohhh i remember you    is this a new problem or same one?
2005-12-29T07:01:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	yea it's me,  It's that same problem
2005-12-29T07:01:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 i thought we left you with a plan of attack last night
2005-12-29T07:02:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	im not at home yet  so i cant check my log
2005-12-29T07:04:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	ahh, does knoppix have a ppc version??
2005-12-29T07:06:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  i thought there was one
2005-12-29T07:06:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I'm not seeing one, but the ubuntu live cd and its brownness distracts me = p
2005-12-29T07:21:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	all i found was a 2year old ppc version of knoppix     the Gentoo PPC LiveCD  is also an option
2005-12-29T07:21:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	alright, I'll just go with ubuntu live
2005-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  im still at work  sorry for the delay with replies
2005-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	It's alright! = )

2005-12-29T07:23:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	That's cool, is it fun?
2005-12-29T07:24:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  as long as the servers dont catch on fire i mess with "tech toys" all day
2005-12-29T07:24:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	= p

2006-01-04T14:45:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	lol, I'm confused what to do..
2006-01-04T14:46:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	 i have to run a min to check on my users,  but   are you doing a fresh install?
2006-01-04T14:46:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	do you know what ubuntu is doing when it is calculating module dependencies at boot?
2006-01-04T14:46:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	I'm trying to repair my system after a dist-upgrade from breezy pre-release to breezy
2006-01-04T14:47:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	It freezes at calculating module dependencies every time after that
2006-01-04T14:47:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	your a network admin right? lol
2006-01-04T14:47:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  yes
2006-01-04T14:48:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	yay.  But do you have any idea what to do to fix my ibook?
2006-01-04T14:48:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  nothing about ibooks :(
2006-01-04T14:48:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	   too busy playing with Linux
2006-01-04T14:48:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	well I'm trying to fix the calculating module dependencies thing
2006-01-04T14:49:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	do I chroot to the harddrive with the livecd, and then what?
2006-01-04T14:49:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	   im not a chroot pro  only used it a few times
2006-01-04T14:50:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	ok, well how do i fix the module dependencies thing? lolol
2006-01-04T14:50:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	   im re-reading your post
2006-01-04T14:51:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  it boots to grub right    have you tried a recovery kernel
2006-01-04T14:51:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  your old ones
2006-01-04T14:53:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	they don't put a recover kernel with the ppc version, anyways, I got the livecd up and my hard drive mounted, I have access to all the files on my harddrive
2006-01-04T14:54:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	   also you can "append"  some commends to your grub boot   to disable all the fancy stuff like acpi   so you can at least boot to fix it
2006-01-04T14:54:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  i dont have a clue  what would help an ibook boot
2006-01-04T14:55:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	ok but I'm booted into the livecd and I can make the changes there, I just don't know what to fix...
2006-01-04T14:55:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  on an ibm lappy i would try disabling acpi and apic
2006-01-04T14:55:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  reinstall the kernel  wold be a start
2006-01-04T14:55:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	ok, should I use apt?
2006-01-04T14:56:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	for some reason, the livecd isn't letting me use my ethernet...
2006-01-04T14:56:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	someone else has to be better for this question    ask   how to chroot into your broekn Ubuntu to reinstalll the kernel
2006-01-04T14:57:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	alright, I am chrooted into it I have a bunch of kernels there, but only the kernel named "Linux" shows up at boot...
2006-01-06T17:17:00.000Z	pashaw	Eleaf	  are you a girl?  lol   j/k
2006-01-06T17:17:00.000Z	Eleaf	pashaw	lol
