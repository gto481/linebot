2009-07-11T22:33:00.000Z	ggg	kevdog	yes it works,but the problem is the guification notifies too much, if someone replies me or if someone asks something to everybody the notification pops up
2009-07-11T22:34:00.000Z	ggg	kevdog	is it possible to restict those notification when someone does not reply me
2009-07-11T22:35:00.000Z	kevdog	ggg	 I have no idea on that one -- that is why I don't use pidgin with irc.
2009-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	kevdog	ggg	chatzilla!!
2009-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	ggg	kevdog	i'm testing the guification configuration ,can you just say some word with me ? just for testing
