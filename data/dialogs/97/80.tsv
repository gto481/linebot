2005-07-25T07:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	that was all over /.
2005-07-25T07:54:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	ppc users (like me) have to use wiki.ubuntu.com//JavaPPC
2005-07-25T07:58:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	yes i know this
2005-07-25T07:58:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	i'm tryin to find out what anne has
2005-07-25T07:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	sorry, my bad
2005-07-25T08:57:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	yes, its smokin hot new
2005-07-26T12:35:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	what wouldn't install?
2005-07-26T12:36:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	i have tiger and ubuntu on the same box, and it works just fine
2005-07-26T12:36:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	OS X Tiger
2005-07-26T12:36:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	it just refused to install? or what?
2005-07-26T12:36:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	the dvd just pops out saying "can't install".
2005-07-26T12:37:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	so i just got rid of my old panther partition and used it for linux :)
2005-07-26T12:38:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	tiger wouldnt install over panther?
2005-07-26T12:38:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	most of the things work just fine. I just need to work on video out, blue tooth with my phone issues. gonna take a look later though
2005-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	so you don't need a sounding board to get tiger back on?
2005-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	my panther partion got fscked. looks like the only way is to format/partition and reinstall everything
2005-07-26T12:40:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	i was just talking about how ubuntu has won me over :)
2005-07-26T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	and that is doable or not? (burning the HD and restarting from scratch)
2005-07-26T12:41:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	yeah...i just need to backup my home directory, and my /etc/
2005-07-26T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	i installed from scratch OSX and linux and had no problems (except Tiger has a taste for yaboot)
2005-07-26T12:42:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	u installed tiger first though?
2005-07-26T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	no, i installed ydl, got pissed at rpmhell, and put ubuntu on it back when warty came out
2005-07-26T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	when i had 10.3
2005-07-26T12:43:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	looks like we followed a similiar route, except i used debian
2005-07-26T12:44:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	upgraded tiger over 10.3 and tiger ate my bootloader
2005-07-26T12:44:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	and that was the only 'excitement' i had
2005-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	i havent had to boot into OS X for anything, so why have it.
2005-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	i havetn booted into osx (to use it) since i went to ubuntu
2005-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	:)
2005-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	however i bought a new mac yestern and have had to firewire-target-mode my ubuntu box
2005-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	congrats!
2005-07-26T15:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	do u know how we add PKG_CONFIG env variable, though
2005-07-26T15:06:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	in your ~/.bashrc
2005-08-28T06:36:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	i agree
2005-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	ncurses-bt + gnu screen
2005-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	:)

2005-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	:)
2005-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	why?
2005-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	i dual boot, and OSX just took a dump on me. diskwarrior reported "too much filesystem damage to repair" (call all$oft for more repair options)
2005-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	okay, so the apple boot disk must not have worked,i presume!
2005-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	that was first in line, and it "repaired" stuff, but not what was terribly damgd
2005-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	maybe it's a sign from the Ubuntu god, to move to ubuntu, and bless the OS X hdd with holy linux pee?
2005-08-31T05:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	i was doing that too, till it crashed on me too. and then, i moved to ubuntu completely. sounds like a pattern :)
2005-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	i'm almost to that point
2005-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	backup your data and format :(
2005-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	nalioth	robotgeek	my thoughts exactly *but may just leave osx off of it
2005-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	as long as got everthing working under linux , i don't see why not
2005-09-13T12:34:00.000Z	robotgeek	nalioth	offtopic, but did u check out the wmv 9 codec under linux/OS X?
