2010-05-12T18:22:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	if you change permission on hardlinks, you'll change file-permissions too (sounds logical to me, both point to same inode)
2010-05-12T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 yep. Hard or soft.. changing the link. changes the orignal file here.. (from what i am seeing)

2010-05-31T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 that one that dims the other windows so she stays focused on the current one is handy. and thers a feature that puts ROOT: in the title of any app running as root

2011-02-13T20:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 now i have to wonder how they got the t option...
2011-02-13T20:51:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	how is easy, chmod 1755 dir    . the "why" is more interesting :)
2011-02-13T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 yea. nautiuls was crashhing when i 'moved' a directory earlier. (did it several times)  i think it left it with the 't' mode.
2011-03-05T18:27:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	don't use killall on Solaris. if you don't know the differences ;)
2011-03-05T18:28:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	only if used as root
2011-03-05T18:38:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	ashworth thats why they changed it into "boot-dir" with is more logic
2011-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 i just pasted whats in my tomboy notes on 'how i reinstall grub' :) note.
2011-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	right, seems there will be a change in coming versions.

2011-06-08T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 yea. i just recall reading those settings files once ages ago. and the oreally book on ssh.
2011-07-14T23:59:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	irc on phone, easier :)
2011-07-15T00:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 the android irc clients ive found so far are a bit lacking.. also ive had issues with AT*T every once in a while wont connect to freenode. due to some odd 'sasl' issue.
2011-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	i like "yaaic", but i don't use sasl.
2011-07-15T00:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 i dont use sasl either.. but its some odd bug/network issue with AT*T and irc it seems..  the irs servers are trying to get sasl info from at*t ip. not the ip of the irc client. (or so ive researched). if i disconnect/get a new ip on the phone.. it will work..
2011-07-15T00:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	llutz	 but for now im sshing, and/or using ZNC :)
2011-07-15T00:04:00.000Z	llutz	Dr_Willis	ah ok
