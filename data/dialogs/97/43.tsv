2007-01-20T08:27:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	http://pastebin.com/863540
2007-01-20T08:28:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	you could use pastebin.ubuntu.nl   might be faster.  being slow for me as well
2007-01-20T08:28:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ok. will do in future.
2007-01-20T08:33:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gconf  && sudo dpkg-reconfigure metacity && sudo dpkg-reconfigure metacity-common && sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-themes
2007-01-20T08:33:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	give it a shot...cant get much worse
2007-01-20T08:33:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ok
2007-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	can you repost that after i've logged into original account please.. apt-get appears not to work from this account :(

2007-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	excellent :) can you repost the command majickery please? :)
2007-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gconf  && sudo dpkg-reconfigure metacity && sudo dpkg-reconfigure metacity-common && sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-themes
2007-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	curious: says gconf not installed..
2007-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	shall i get that?
2007-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	sudo dpkg --purge gconf && sudo apt-get install gconf
2007-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ok. thanks.
2007-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	may need to remove &&, dpkg could fail, thats alright, mainly need to install gconf
2007-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	by remove && i mean place a | in place of it ;P
2007-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ah, ok.. wasn't familiar with && syntax
2007-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	&& checks if last cmd fails before it succeeds.  pipe (|) does not check success of cmds , it just goes rambo
2007-01-20T08:44:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	all done.
2007-01-20T08:44:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	do i need to logout?

2007-01-20T09:27:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	well...i guess the only option is to reinstall...unless you dont mind me VNCing in and seeing what i can do... i wouldn't mind
2007-01-20T09:27:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	um. reinstall :( vnc ok.. we'd need to use hamachi, though..
2007-01-20T09:28:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	proper stuff. you're a gent.. me too.. need to install hamachi and vnc..
2007-01-20T09:28:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	sudo apt-get install vino-server   for vnc
2007-01-20T09:28:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ok. thanks.
2007-01-20T09:30:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	vino-server? not found..
2007-01-20T09:30:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	just vino actually
2007-01-20T09:31:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ok. ta.
2007-01-20T09:32:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	vino appears to be installed.. just getting hamachi.
2007-01-20T09:34:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	where do i drop the hamachi dir (from downloaded archive)? or is there a simpler install method?
2007-01-20T09:34:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	download the tar file to your home dir, extract it.  then go into the hamachi dir and follow the README
2007-01-20T09:40:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	any luck?  get hamachi installed?
2007-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	sorry. network outage :( um. issues with hamachi..
2007-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	will see if i can resolve them.

2007-01-20T09:58:00.000Z	xtknight	idea	i'll be on maybe in a couple hours, im not sure
2007-01-20T09:58:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	ok. thanks for all your help so far.
2007-01-20T10:05:00.000Z	idea	xtknight	fwiw, now have hamachi running, but blank pass is invalid, apparently.
