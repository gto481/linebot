2007-12-08T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	heh. PC Mag, what do you expect? It's not Compute
2007-12-08T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 the editors could  of at least corrected the mistake in the comments. :)
2007-12-15T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	you'd have to send me back to school, I never learned event driven programming, it came after I retired

2007-12-24T01:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	seems to be opera and konq problems are holding up the fix
2007-12-24T01:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 interesting...
2007-12-24T01:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 and here i was thinking the fix was just the changing of a filename in the installer script
2007-12-24T01:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	you can read https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/173890 if you  have an hour to spare :)
2007-12-24T08:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	aren't you being a bit conservative?
2007-12-24T08:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 it will get MUCH worse when theres a new release. :)
2007-12-25T04:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	if you mean the libdvdread3 one, it installs 1.2.5 , when medibuntu has 1.2.9
2007-12-25T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 no idea. :) i rarely watch actual dvds
2007-12-25T04:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	and I've seen no diff, but ...
2007-12-25T04:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 i havent either. :) if one can read the dvd.. what can the other do thats so much better? Perhaps just bug fix's
2007-12-25T04:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	I read the changelog, and the changes were pretty trivial
2007-12-25T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	that's why swap needs to be BIG
2007-12-29T02:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	vmware is also, it's in deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu gutsy partner

2008-01-16T07:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	it's a mount time parameter
2008-01-16T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 i dont think it works for any other fylesystem either.. i just dont have any other  to test to prove the point. :)
2008-01-16T07:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	I'll mess with my i386 partition
2008-01-16T07:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Dr_willis	ok, I had /i386 in as root:root.  Mounted a partition there, it was root:root . chowned to rich:rich.   unmounted, /i386 was root:root.  Mounted again, it was rich:rich

2008-02-09T09:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 i would just be happy if i coulf figure out a nice simple way to get all the dev files needed for a given source package easially. :)

2008-02-09T09:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	nickrud	 :) yep..  but if its  a known package.. i just use the debs heh.
