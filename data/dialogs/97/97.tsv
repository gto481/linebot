2004-11-13T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	in theory, you should be able to throw fonts in /usr/share/fonts and just have em show up  :/
2004-11-13T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	if thats not working, I dunno...

2004-12-10T15:47:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	to play mainly...
2004-12-10T15:47:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	I have nothing against any OS... just prefer Linux  :)
2004-12-10T15:47:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	2K would do it for you...?
2004-12-10T15:48:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	but I have 2k3 ...

2004-12-10T16:31:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	bah, it just came up  :(
2004-12-10T16:31:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	he probably gets bored with it to, after all it's about the distro not the millionair
2004-12-10T16:31:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	you think anyone who buys a record at Virgin Records swoons about Richard's millions? yawn
2004-12-10T16:31:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	the millionaire pays for the distro...  without him, we would be using Fedora or Debian...
2004-12-10T16:32:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	I do  *shrug*  :P
2004-12-10T16:32:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	true but I just don't get the hype
2004-12-10T16:32:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	ps, he is rich... worth $12b
2004-12-10T16:32:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	good for him :)
2004-12-10T16:33:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	ah never mind, I am just not easily impressed by things like that :P
2004-12-10T16:33:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	money makes the world go round... simple fact...
2004-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	sad but true
2004-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	lost a few girls due to not having enough money right now  :/
2004-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	you didn't want to be with women like that to begin with.. period
2004-12-10T16:36:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	security is relative
2004-12-10T16:37:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	haha... you're not picky at all  :P
2004-12-10T16:37:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	nope, just a fun guy that likes linux.. and mr. Bo heheh
2004-12-10T16:38:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	oh yeah huh  :P
2004-12-10T16:39:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	ohh... now I get it  :)
2004-12-10T16:40:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	you don't scare us just cuz you're female
2004-12-10T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	only cuz you're so far away though  :P
2004-12-10T16:41:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	you should be.. I am not your average one
2004-12-10T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	all girls say that  :(
2004-12-10T16:41:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	thought I had proven that to you by now
2004-12-10T16:43:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	I still fail to see how that makes you not like any other girl though... most girls play mind games... you appear to like to also... Linux is just a hobby... no 2 females share everything in common  :P
2004-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	morning  :P

2004-12-15T09:55:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	which one? I've seen all that I know of  :o
2004-12-15T09:57:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	ahh, that seems like it would make a cool desklet  :)   not sure how possible it is though?  and I think there is already a rss gdesklet?
2004-12-15T09:58:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	|trey|	like I said that one sucks donkey balls! I want a really cool neato one like the pic
2004-12-15T09:58:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	heh... I didn't see that you wanted a rss desklet... yeah, would have difficulties in the layout, but would be a fun project  :)
2004-12-15T09:58:00.000Z	|trey|	Tsjoklat	wait, wtf?
