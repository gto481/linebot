2005-03-19T08:52:00.000Z	ells	back_east	I can open it but it wont let me resize
2005-03-19T08:53:00.000Z	back_east	ells	what's the format of the partition you are trying to resize?
2005-03-19T08:54:00.000Z	ells	back_east	the windows side
2005-03-19T08:54:00.000Z	ells	back_east	also, it wont let me do any linux partitions either
2005-03-19T08:55:00.000Z	back_east	ells	and does it give you an error message?
2005-03-19T08:57:00.000Z	back_east	ells	is that hoary or warty?

2005-03-19T09:00:00.000Z	back_east	ells	Have you checked the ubuntu forums?
2005-03-19T09:03:00.000Z	back_east	ells	If you select a partition the resize option stays disabled?
2005-03-19T09:04:00.000Z	ells	back_east	yes

2005-03-19T09:06:00.000Z	back_east	ells	Try unmounting the partitions and running qtparted again.

2005-03-19T09:11:00.000Z	ells	back_east	yeap, the only icons able to click are delete, format, and set active
2005-03-19T09:13:00.000Z	back_east	ells	well I don't know what to tell you.

2005-03-19T09:51:00.000Z	ells	back_east	I would have thought there would be a gui for using the netapplet
2005-03-19T09:52:00.000Z	back_east	ells	oh that's the new one
2005-03-19T09:52:00.000Z	back_east	ells	that shows the wireless networks

2005-03-19T09:56:00.000Z	ells	back_east	will try
2005-03-19T09:56:00.000Z	back_east	ells	it isn't in there?

2005-03-19T10:09:00.000Z	back_east	ells	My card won't scan, so it can't use netapplet anyway
