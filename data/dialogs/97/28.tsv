2008-01-17T08:03:00.000Z	Djerkaf		Hello, does anyone know how to get around the "bios age(1999) fails cutoff(2000)" problem?
2008-01-17T08:05:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	that reminds me of the millenium bug,.,.lol
2008-01-17T08:05:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	I have read comments about the millennium bug several times when googling the problem.
2008-01-17T08:06:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	the milennium bug was a bios problem due to the fact that they could not understand that there could be any date after 31/12/1999 ,.,. a bios update usually fixed the problem i think ,.,. but do u/ have u ever had a syystem without this error?
2008-01-17T08:08:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	I have got that error on all old computers I've tried to install it on.
2008-01-17T08:08:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	is ur machines bios fully up-to-date?
2008-01-17T08:09:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	is ur bios up to date?
2008-01-17T08:09:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	It's an old PC, the bios is from that date I wrote, 07/29/1999
2008-01-17T08:09:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	I guess
2008-01-17T08:10:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	Hard to find information about it
2008-01-17T08:10:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	yer i no,.,. find out wot motherboard ur using then search google for newer bios's
2008-01-17T08:10:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	ul have to make a bootable floppy to install the new bios
2008-01-17T08:11:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	I have the latest bios for my motherboard.
2008-01-17T08:12:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	r u saying that a motherboard u have has no idea that the world doesnt end on the date u said earlier?
2008-01-17T08:12:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	Is it simply enough impossible to install an ubuntu system on a computer from before 2000 ?
2008-01-17T08:12:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	NO ,.,. i have succesfully solved this problem
2008-01-17T08:12:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	Not really sure what you mean. The system clock is correct, but the bios is from 07/29/1999.
2008-01-17T08:13:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	so wots the problem?
2008-01-17T08:13:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	Well I get that error message, that should be pretty obvious from my first message here. :P
2008-01-17T08:14:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	wot error message ,.,. sorry didnt c it?
2008-01-17T08:14:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	the message disappears when using noacpi , but it can't identify the format of the disk when partitioning.
2008-01-17T08:14:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	"bios age(1999) fails cutoff(2000)"
2008-01-17T08:14:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	yer trust me that is an outdated bios,.,. u DONT HAVE THE LATEST BIOS
2008-01-17T08:15:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	And you are sure of that, just like that, without knowing when the motherboard was stopped made?
2008-01-17T08:16:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	I can't even find my specific board on the manufacturor's homepage. I'm pretty sure I'm shit out of luck when it comes to bios updating.
2008-01-17T08:16:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	either im right or the motherboard ur using is 1 of a kind and no one has fixed the milennium bug
2008-01-17T08:16:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	have u googled ur motherboard name?
2008-01-17T08:17:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	Well. Yes. Otherwise I wouldn't be in this room.
2008-01-17T08:17:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	Maybe it does not have to do with the millennium bug.
2008-01-17T08:17:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	since it can't identify the format of my drive, and freezes.
2008-01-17T08:17:00.000Z	bod_	Djerkaf	so no one else in the entire world has the same motherboard as u?
2008-01-17T08:17:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	I have only found a few sites with the same board.
2008-01-17T08:18:00.000Z	Djerkaf	bod_	but haven't found anyone having the same problem as I, with ubuntu.
