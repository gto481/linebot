2005-05-14T07:28:00.000Z	afroman		hi
2005-05-14T07:29:00.000Z	afroman		anyone can help me transfer files from my pc to another using ethernet
2005-05-14T07:29:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Any protocol in particular?
2005-05-14T07:29:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	none that I know of...
2005-05-14T07:29:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	FTP, SCP, rsync, http, netcat, nfs, smb, ...
2005-05-14T07:29:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	...take your pick.
2005-05-14T07:30:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	What's your local system, what's the remote system?
2005-05-14T07:30:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I have stationary that has Ubuntu and a laptop that has Debian and Windows
2005-05-14T07:30:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Will you be wanting to transfer files frequently?
2005-05-14T07:31:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I want to know to transfer Linux to Linux, and Linux to Windows... protocal won't matter, just tell me the easiest
2005-05-14T07:32:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Easiest would be to set up a share on the linux system and access that from other hosts.
2005-05-14T07:32:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Otherwise, you can put the files on your webserver ($HOME/public_html/ or /var/www/), or scp them between systems.
2005-05-14T07:33:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	U mean like a soort of server
2005-05-14T07:33:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Speak english please.
2005-05-14T07:33:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	U mean like a sort of server
2005-05-14T07:34:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	You'll need a server running in general.  Web, SSH, FTP, Sambe...
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	SSH lets you copy individual files back and forth:  scp localfile user@remotehost:file
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	ok... let's take step by step
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	... FTP is sort of similar.  HTTP lets you stage files and copy them from the server but not the other way, without a few tricks.
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	...and a remote filesystem (samba, NFS) lets you access the remote files like any other, pretty much.
2005-05-14T07:36:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I'm a beginer, plz take it slow
2005-05-14T07:36:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I have files in Windows, how do I transfer them to Linux
2005-05-14T07:36:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Explain what you want to do, and how often.  You've got some choices to make.  My suggestion remains that you should set up a samba share.
2005-05-14T07:37:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	...which will let you copy files (command line, Windows Explorer, other tools) without thinking about it.
2005-05-14T07:37:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	See above wrt "how do I transfer..."
2005-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Install samba-server
2005-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	no, I mean between 2 pcs
2005-05-14T07:38:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Install samba-server
2005-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Actually, it's just 'samba'.
2005-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	in apt-get I see many... wot do U recommand
2005-05-14T07:39:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	'aptitude install samba'
2005-05-14T07:43:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Still here?
2005-05-14T07:43:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Launch your file manager.
2005-05-14T07:43:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	ya but I seem to have a problem installing SAmba
2005-05-14T07:44:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	OK, let's try something else.
2005-05-14T07:44:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Launch your file manager.  'nautilus'.
2005-05-14T07:45:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I installed Samba
2005-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	OK, actually, I'm going to try something a little different, but we can use that later.
2005-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	As I've asked three times:  start your file manager, nautilus.
2005-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	done
2005-05-14T07:46:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	What's your Windows system's IP address?
2005-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	192.168.1.3
2005-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Enter:  "smb://192.168.1.3/" in the nautilus nav box.
2005-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	how?? it is a window manager...
2005-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	It's also a file manager.  Launch your file manager.
2005-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	how?? I only see my files in root
2005-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	r you still there??? I wrote nautilus in the terminal and there opened the window manager
2005-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Still here.
2005-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Good.
2005-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	smb://<ip of windows box>/
2005-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	in the terminal...???
2005-05-14T07:53:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	In natilus's nav window.
2005-05-14T07:54:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I only have 1 ethernet card... so I might need to get offline for this
2005-05-14T07:55:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	but how should I proceed if it works???
2005-05-14T07:56:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Well, whichever way it goes, let me know.
2005-05-14T07:56:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	but wot might happen??
2005-05-14T07:57:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	I'll trust you to figure it out.  If it works you'll either get a listing of shares, or you'll be prompted for a username/password.
2005-05-14T07:57:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	If it doesn't, plug in here and ask.
2005-05-14T07:58:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	aight... thx a lot
2005-05-14T08:42:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	hi again

2005-05-14T08:52:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	Sorry, was AFK.
2005-05-14T08:55:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	It should be configured sanely out of the box.
2005-05-14T08:55:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	'ssh localhost' to test.
2005-05-14T08:58:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	the test, how do I know if it works or not...??? it is just standing still
2005-05-14T08:58:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	'ssh -v localhost'.
2005-05-14T08:58:00.000Z	karsten	afroman	...you should at some point get a password prompt, or a timeout.
2005-05-14T08:59:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	how long do I have to wait...??
2005-05-14T09:02:00.000Z	afroman	karsten	I waited nothing came
