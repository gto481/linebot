2006-04-03T07:22:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	wait a minute; there ARE dashboardy things??!
2006-04-03T07:22:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	and are dynamic. The uses are almost limitless
2006-04-03T07:23:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	yes you can use for system stats, email, rss, weather, news, media player controller
2006-04-03T07:23:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	they use a little ram but not much else
2006-04-03T07:23:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	and is the set up in the pic using gnome? its skinned all wierd

2006-04-03T11:56:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	right...asterisks is a VOIP provider?
2006-04-03T11:56:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	with Asterisk basically you pay 10% of what Vonage costs and you operate the phone company from linux
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	woah...SWEEEEET!
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	now that is pretty badass.
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	but why do you need it?

2006-04-03T12:00:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	as an added bonus... SIP calls (like Skype and Gizmo) now ring on my home phone.
2006-04-03T12:00:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	for sure...you might as well take advantage right

2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	I can program the caller ID to anything I want too LOL
2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	rishi	iGotNoTime	but, if she's a "1", and you can't get rid of her...at least you'll never have to answer the phone!
2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	iGotNoTime	rishi	no joke you become the phone company
