2006-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	you're still using Breezy (5.10)?
2006-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	that's Breezy's kernel original kernel. You're out of date.
2006-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	i updated via internet
2006-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	i have usplash and so on like in dapper
2006-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	but you're using an old kernel.
2006-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	so. ``sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade''
2006-06-29T05:04:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	but on this kernel this sound worked fine!
2006-06-29T05:05:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	and that kernel is incompatible with Dapper's udev!
2006-06-29T05:06:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	i started dist-upgrade but no kernel upgrade there
2006-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	``sudo apt-get install linux-image-386''
2006-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	after instaling new kernel my sound should be work?
2006-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	is it installing 2.6.15-25-386?
2006-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	it say that my version it good
2006-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	what does that mean?
2006-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	it don't want update kernel
2006-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	pastebin the entire command you're using and the output
2006-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	you don't understand because it's on russian
2006-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	$LANG doesn't matter
2006-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/74383
2006-06-29T05:15:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	my dist-upgrade think that i have new kernel
2006-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	ls /boot/vmlinuz*
2006-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12-9-386  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-25-386
2006-06-29T05:18:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	reboot into 2.6.15-25-386, and we'll continue troubleshooting
2006-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	What should i change in grup to reboot with another kernel
2006-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	just choose the 2.6.15-25-386 kernel in the grub menu
2006-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	do you also use nvidia/fglrx drivers?
2006-06-29T05:20:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	there no such kernel in grub menu. No i don't use nvidia
2006-06-29T05:21:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	you don't have an 2.6.15 entries in /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2006-06-29T05:21:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	what should i change in grub
2006-06-29T05:22:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	you need an entry for the new 2.6.15-25-386 kernel. Installing it should have created it for you. Did it not?
2006-06-29T05:25:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	i have two ubuntu on hard drive. i don't understand what in grub i used lilo befor ubuntu
2006-06-29T05:26:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	then you need to tell lilo about the new kernel.
2006-06-29T05:27:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	does Ubuntu on your install boot using grub or lilo?
2006-06-29T05:27:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/74396 my grub
2006-06-29T05:28:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	right, choose the top one.
2006-06-29T05:28:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	--->  Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-25-386
2006-06-29T05:29:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	which one booting not from hda1?
2006-06-29T05:30:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	I don't understand what you just said
2006-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	I have 2 Ubuntu on one hard drive first is not this system
2006-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	do you mean you have two different Ubuntu installations on two different root partitions?
2006-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	yes
2006-06-29T05:33:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	and newer kernel is on another installation
2006-06-29T05:34:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	those two kernels, according to the paste you showed me, are in the same /
2006-06-29T05:35:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	just a moment i reboot and check
2006-06-29T05:42:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	my boot menu is not in menu.lst it is in menu.lst~
2006-06-29T05:42:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	it boot's from backup file
2006-06-29T05:43:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	ok, well, do whatever you need to do to boot 2.6.15-25-286
2006-06-29T05:44:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	but in menu.lst~ there are no such kernel
2006-06-29T05:44:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	so cp menu.lst menu.lst~
2006-06-29T05:45:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	like I said, you know your system better than I do, so just make it boot 2.6.15-25-386
2006-06-29T05:47:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	Can I boot now from lilo? I don't like grub i don't understand it
2006-06-29T05:48:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	if you install (re)lilo and remove grub, sure
2006-06-29T06:09:00.000Z	smax	crimsun	how keep changes in grub ( like command lilo after changes)
2006-06-29T06:09:00.000Z	crimsun	smax	update-grub
