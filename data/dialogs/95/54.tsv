2007-03-11T15:57:00.000Z	Kosssu		meh, wants the command to start mysqld? ive looked over 60 pages on forums, but nobody mentions it
2007-03-11T15:58:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
2007-03-11T15:59:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	did you get errors?
2007-03-11T15:59:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	none
2007-03-11T15:59:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	How did you install mysql?
2007-03-11T16:00:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	from synaptic
2007-03-11T16:00:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	well if you install from synaptic mysql should be running.
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	perhaps you didn't install mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	had to reinstall it, because I wasn't able to change root for some reason
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	well root by default has no password also.
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	and if you reinstalled without purging you will have the same issue.
2007-03-11T16:02:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	thats what i figured, however mythtv had other plans about that
2007-03-11T16:02:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	try sudo aptitude purge mysql mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:02:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	Then sudo aptitude install mysql mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:02:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	mmk, its setup. Should I try starting it now?
2007-03-11T16:03:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	well it should be running .
2007-03-11T16:03:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	lsmod | grep mysql
2007-03-11T16:03:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	returns nothing
2007-03-11T16:03:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	wai tthat will return nothing.
2007-03-11T16:04:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	hold up let me try somehting
2007-03-11T16:04:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	try sudo /etc/init.d/mysql status
2007-03-11T16:05:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	returns " * MySQL is stopped."
2007-03-11T16:05:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	you have to use sudo
2007-03-11T16:06:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	i did
2007-03-11T16:06:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	well sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
2007-03-11T16:06:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	i always use sudo, just in case
2007-03-11T16:06:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	stopped it fine, however failed to start it.
2007-03-11T16:07:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	Did it give an erro or just say fail
2007-03-11T16:07:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	just a red fail
2007-03-11T16:08:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	okay check in /var/log/mysql.err
2007-03-11T16:08:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	file empty
2007-03-11T16:09:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	yeah i'm looking for a proper log.
2007-03-11T16:10:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	hrm.. did mysql ever work?
2007-03-11T16:11:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	Ive never used it, this is a fairly fresh install, I reinstalled mysql earlier due to problems with mythtv not being able to connect to server
2007-03-11T16:11:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	did you purge it like I showed you?
2007-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	then try installing again just now?
2007-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	purge?
2007-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	alright sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
2007-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	oh yeah, I did
2007-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	then sudo aptitude purge mysql mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:12:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	then sudo aptitude install mysql mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:13:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	I have no idea why it isn't logging to /var/log/
2007-03-11T16:13:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	i got 2 versions of mysql server 2
2007-03-11T16:13:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	both installed, that might cause a conflict?
2007-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	yeap
2007-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	how'd you get 2 version installed?
2007-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	did you install a deb or smoething?
2007-03-11T16:14:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	don't think their 100% identical
2007-03-11T16:15:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	when trying to uninstall mysql it returned alot of errors since mythtv was installed
2007-03-11T16:15:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	had to remove mythtv in order to even uninstall mysql
2007-03-11T16:16:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	Kosssu there should be a mysql-server then another mysql-server if you dpkg -l | grep mysql  one is binaries one is meta package
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	okay logging is turned off by default in /etc/mysql/my.cnf
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	if you edit that file you can enable loggin by removing the # inf front of the log line.
2007-03-11T16:19:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	then try to sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start    once it fails check you /var/log/mysql.log  for some errors
2007-03-11T16:20:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	which file to edit?
2007-03-11T16:20:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	Do you have a desktop on this machine or just terminal?
2007-03-11T16:20:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	gksu gedit /etc/mysql/my.cnf
2007-03-11T16:21:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	look for the line that says #log /var/log/msyql.log
2007-03-11T16:21:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	remove the # from the front of that line.
2007-03-11T16:23:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	was in process of reinstall mysql from synaptic and it returned alot of errors
2007-03-11T16:23:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	E: mysql-server-5.0: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
2007-03-11T16:24:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude reinstall mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:24:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	copy and paste that in terminal
2007-03-11T16:25:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	returning same error in terminal too
2007-03-11T16:26:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop          In a terminal

2007-03-11T16:30:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9794/
2007-03-11T16:32:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	alright sudo aptitude purge mysql-server-5.0 mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:33:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	done
2007-03-11T16:33:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	now try sudo aptitude install mysql-server   Shouldn't error out this time.

2007-03-11T16:35:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	mysql-server depends on mysql-server-5.0; however:
2007-03-11T16:36:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	I dunno something is messed up beyond my knowledge on that one.  Try posting to the forums.  Make sure you put in the error you are getting when trying to install mysql-server
2007-03-11T16:36:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	should I try configuring mysql-server-5.0?
2007-03-11T16:36:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	you could try sudo dpkg-configure mysql-server-5.0
2007-03-11T16:37:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	but don't think that is going to help.
2007-03-11T16:37:00.000Z	Kosssu	h1st0	command not found :(
2007-03-11T16:38:00.000Z	h1st0	Kosssu	sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.0
