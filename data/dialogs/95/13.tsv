2010-04-01T04:30:00.000Z	crogeek		hi to all
2010-04-01T04:31:00.000Z	crogeek		I have couple of questions
2010-04-01T04:31:00.000Z	crogeek		first I have radeon 9600 pro AGP card on my p4 PC and I cannot run 3d effects, I am using regular drivers from kernel of Ubuntu
2010-04-01T04:31:00.000Z	crogeek		secondly, why software reposierties are not updated to the end?
2010-04-01T04:31:00.000Z	crogeek		I saw latest Firefox is 3.5.8 in rep.
2010-04-01T04:33:00.000Z	crogeek		can someone explain me how to download latest ATI driver for my graph. card and run 3d effects, I know it should work, in 9.04 on my radeon 9600 that worked well
2010-04-01T04:33:00.000Z	crogeek		and I saw that Firefox isn't updated, even in software rep. I didn't see any new ver
2010-04-01T04:34:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	when there are updates the update manager should prompt you if nothing was changed in the notification settings. otherwise all is well.
2010-04-01T04:35:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: that's okay, but as I see 3.5.8 has major security flaws and I don't wanna to have non-updated version of FF
2010-04-01T04:36:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	ubuntu patches security flows and releases updates just for ubuntupackages
2010-04-01T04:36:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	also flaws
2010-04-01T04:36:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: even in Firefox ?
2010-04-01T04:36:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	yes
2010-04-01T04:37:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	all packages that come installed with ubuntu get all necessary security patches
2010-04-01T04:37:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: so this means (from my personal point of view) that Ubuntu dev. team can patch Firefox flaws even on outdated version on FF?
2010-04-01T04:37:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	yep. that's how 'fixed release' linux distributions work. they pick a version of some software and stick with it for the lifetime of the version.
2010-04-01T04:38:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	for your ati, did you follow this yet?: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2010-04-01T04:39:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: I will try to fix that, because I cannot get to run 3d effects on my Ubuntu with radeon 9600 also Adobe's Flash is running very slow on Streaming flash based web sites, I disabled hardware acceleration and that is now working well, but some lags are there still :(
2010-04-01T04:50:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: I will try to do now
2010-04-01T04:51:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: look this

2010-04-01T05:48:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	i do not know. somehow the driver wasn't setup properly. just removing and reinstalling some stuff was the fix.
2010-04-01T05:51:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: only what lags is now Flash video, but I think that's because I have not good graph. card
2010-04-01T05:51:00.000Z	chelz	crogeek	flash lags everywhere unfortunately
2010-04-01T05:51:00.000Z	crogeek	chelz	: that's problem of Adobe?
