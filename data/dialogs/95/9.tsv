2010-09-21T00:12:00.000Z	xbonesx		so how many people in here get paid to sit in here and help out us newbies?
2010-09-21T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	nobody
2010-09-21T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	everyone is a volunteer
2010-09-21T00:13:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	thats real nice
2010-09-22T11:16:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	find: paths must precede expression: apps
2010-09-22T11:17:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	/apps/metacity/general/theme
2010-09-23T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	the debs are in /var/cache/apt/archives you can copy them out and use them on other rigs, or you can use aptoncd to make a handy cd of them
2010-09-23T18:45:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	iim almost positive ive downloaded way more than whats in the folder...
2010-09-23T18:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	thats what apt-get / software centre use to store them
2010-09-23T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	if you run: sudo apt-get clean    it will, or if you run: sudo apt-get autoclean   they will not be stored
2010-09-27T13:29:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	do you know what the different "vga=ox***" number mean?
2010-09-27T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gensplash  75% of the way down, found it with bing.
2010-09-27T13:33:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	do you know what the 1920x1200x64 would be?
2010-09-27T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	i use this: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/    you can just set the res you like uses the fb driver
2010-09-27T13:37:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	when i run the livecd it shows at its full res, and doesnt include the vga=0x*** line, should i remove it from the installed grub line to get full res?
2010-09-27T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	not sure then, you'll need to take some action though to get it rocking. I use that guide to make mine run at a decent res and on nvidia based rigs (most of mine are) I have to use it or I get no boot splash
2010-09-27T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	there is no x32 afaik, 32bit in windows is 24 in linux
2010-09-27T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	just add it as a boot option in /etc/default/grub   you'll need the extra packages defined in that guide
2010-09-27T13:43:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	I did that in the file but it still doesnt show at 1920x1200, think it maxes at 1600x1200, but i also have already installed and uninstalled startupmanager that had a gui for setting to 1600x1200, so i think that think is overriding the res setting
2010-09-27T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	then I am unsure, did you install the extra packages the guide advises?
2010-09-27T13:44:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	what guide again?
2010-09-27T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/
2010-09-27T13:47:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	yes i have followed that TUT, but like i said i think startupmanager files are overriding somewhere in the system...
2010-09-27T13:49:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	do you know the progress of the theming for grub2?
2010-09-27T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	the files for grub will be used to determine grub's resolution
2010-09-27T13:49:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	last i heard it was still in development?
2010-09-27T13:49:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	do you know the progress of the theming for grub2?
2010-09-27T13:49:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	last i heard it was still in development?
2010-09-27T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	http://linux.aldeby.org/configure-grub2-options-and-background.html
2010-09-27T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	hardly worth it imho, the screen is only displayed for about 3 seconds
2010-09-27T13:53:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	good point but its more about the eyecandy, not staring at the same lame screen all the time, a nice GUI makes everything better lmao
2010-09-27T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	your call
2010-09-27T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	i guess if you have nothing better to tweak
2010-09-27T13:54:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	do you know of the project or where downloads are located for the themes of grub2?
2010-09-27T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	no idea, grub doesn't interest me as I single boot systems so I never have to see it
2010-09-27T13:55:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	good point, i havent weened myself off of win7 yet lol

2010-09-27T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	its GRUB backwards, it's an alternate (and unofficial) boot loader

2010-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	sure, grab an xbox to usb converter if it already isn't usb and you should be ok
2010-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	so "sudo modprobe xpad" ???
2010-09-30T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	yeah should do it. You can add it in /etc/modules if it flys
2010-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	you may need jscalibrator to make it nice
2010-09-30T11:59:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	is there a config file for xpad?
2010-09-30T12:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	it should obey whatever config there is for jscalibrator

2010-09-30T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xbonesx	you'll need to install it. Try running it in terminal, you'll be shown some suggested packages
2010-09-30T12:03:00.000Z	xbonesx	ActionParsnip	couldnt find it in synaptic, means it wont show if i run "sudo apt-get install" either right?
