2007-06-22T12:26:00.000Z	god	wols_	i use ppp0

2007-06-22T12:41:00.000Z	god	wols_	thanks a lot for the help by the way :D
2007-06-22T12:42:00.000Z	wols_	god	before you start any new ppp connection, STOP the old ones first. you only want pppp0
2007-06-22T12:43:00.000Z	god	wols_	i have no other connections on that pc ... i installed the sys from scratch...than i only configured adsl
2007-06-22T12:43:00.000Z	wols_	god	it more looks like a modem hardware or ISP issue. but I still donw't get how you can connect via wireless to it. also, your 2nd PC you have, is it connected to the internt too when you use ppp?
2007-06-22T12:43:00.000Z	god	wols_	it is the same problem on 2 computers :(
2007-06-22T12:43:00.000Z	wols_	god	are both computers connected via ppp?
2007-06-22T12:44:00.000Z	god	wols_	maybe i messed things up?!  2 computers are conected seperately ( i only have one cable to go to internet )
2007-06-22T12:44:00.000Z	wols_	god	are both computers connected via that ppp connection on that modem?
2007-06-22T12:44:00.000Z	wols_	god	at the same time?
2007-06-22T12:45:00.000Z	god	wols_	the only way i was able to go to internet through ubuntu... i set up a network in windows, so that the win PC is connected to internet and others connect through this win PC through wireless to internet...than i used ubuntu pc to connect to win wireless...and internet worked perfectly with no config ...
2007-06-22T12:46:00.000Z	god	wols_	yes, i am using the same connection right now, and it works perfectly with windows
2007-06-22T12:46:00.000Z	wols_	god	yes. either that or use the ubuntu PC only to go tto the internet and connect the Windows PC to the ubuntu PC via 2nd network car din ubuntu or wireless
2007-06-22T12:47:00.000Z	wols_	god	and as soon as you use ubunut and the windows machine is still on you get problems?
2007-06-22T12:47:00.000Z	god	wols_	but how i make it so that ubuntu pc goes to internet on its own? da solo ? with no other pc connected?
2007-06-22T12:48:00.000Z	wols_	god	does that give you the error when you do that?
2007-06-22T12:48:00.000Z	wols_	god	cause you said you had your problems with both. you can only have one PC connected directly to the internet. never both
2007-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	god	wols_	no no no... first i tried to connect to internet using my first pc...i failed... so i installed ubuntu an the other pc...but the same problem came up :( ubuntu just doesn't want to work with internet :( i am not connecting two pc's at the same time
2007-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	wols_	god	well you said the windows pc worked on the internet. and you sais both PCs had the same error
2007-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	god	wols_	i can only go to internet using windows... or connecting ubuntu pc to the windows pc using wifi
2007-06-22T12:52:00.000Z	god	wols_	ok i ll try to make it simple... there is only one PC and it doesn't connect to the internet for longer than 2 seconds, what shall i do?
2007-06-22T12:54:00.000Z	god	wols_	do u know any other instances like mine?
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	god	wols_	did u give up on me ?
2007-06-22T12:58:00.000Z	wols_	god	give me a clear ppp log without wout ppp1 and ppp2 used. one pppd at a time for clarity
2007-06-22T13:00:00.000Z	god	wols_	i ll switch internet to the other pc...generate the log...n i ll be back in less than 10 minutes ok?! the problem is not just with web pages but also with software downloads and updates (though the ubuntu system
2007-06-22T13:00:00.000Z	wols_	god	hose are webpages too even if you don't see it. try irc

2007-06-22T13:52:00.000Z	god	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26784/
2007-06-22T13:52:00.000Z	god	wols_	did u get the two links?
2007-06-22T13:55:00.000Z	god	wols_	what does "Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP" mean? can this be the problem?
2007-06-22T13:56:00.000Z	wols_	god	do you have more than one ethernet ion that ubuntu PC?
2007-06-22T13:57:00.000Z	wols_	god	and you again started several pppd something I explicitly told you NOT to do
2007-06-22T13:57:00.000Z	wols_	god	and what is connected to your eth1?
2007-06-22T13:58:00.000Z	god	wols_	nothing eth 1 is not used at all
2007-06-22T13:58:00.000Z	wols_	god	it is
2007-06-22T13:59:00.000Z	wols_	god	no that's not for you
2007-06-22T14:01:00.000Z	god	wols_	the second internet card is not used
2007-06-22T14:03:00.000Z	wols_	god	it is connected to something
2007-06-22T14:04:00.000Z	god	wols_	but it is not, i have nothing in it... there is no cable connected...and i don't think that's the problem because in the other pc i only have one internet card
2007-06-22T14:05:00.000Z	god	wols_	i guess i am stuck with usinf wireless :)
2007-06-22T14:05:00.000Z	wols_	god	what card is that then and why does it get dhcp offers from 192.168.1.1?
2007-06-22T14:05:00.000Z	wols_	god	then why the heck do you use ppp?
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	wols_	god	sotp using ppp
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	god	wols_	because it is an adsl modem...
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	wols_	god	you don#t have a modem, you have a router!
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	wols_	god	it's no adsl modem, it's arouter
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	god	wols_	so how do i set up the internet connection than?
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	wols_	god	rmeove all pppd stuff
2007-06-22T14:06:00.000Z	god	wols_	how ?
2007-06-22T14:07:00.000Z	wols_	god	rest will take care by itself
2007-06-22T14:08:00.000Z	wols_	god	your adsl router has username and password
2007-06-22T14:08:00.000Z	god	wols_	it says modem adsl on it...it can't be the router :(
2007-06-22T14:09:00.000Z	wols_	god	what device is it? what model/brand?
2007-06-22T14:13:00.000Z	wols_	god	look on your manual on page 16. or look at page 16 here: http://dlink-me.com/ftp/modems/DSL-302T/DSL302T_Manual_2_00.pdf
2007-06-22T14:14:00.000Z	wols_	god	you remove ALL ppp stuff and then use a browser to connect to http://192.168.1.1 and there you configure it
2007-06-22T14:14:00.000Z	wols_	god	you enter usename password there on the modem and let it connect
2007-06-22T14:16:00.000Z	god	wols_	ok thank you...it is just that i had tu use a software packeage for pc
2007-06-22T14:16:00.000Z	god	wols_	thanks a lot
2007-06-22T14:16:00.000Z	wols_	god	if you do that you shouldn't need a software package anymore
