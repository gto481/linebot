2007-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	yw
2007-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	IF I have a swap partition from another linux install can I use one for both and just edit the fstab in ubunto to point to it?
2007-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	sure
2007-07-26T12:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	sound juicer and grip both look up freedb afaik
2007-07-26T12:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Soundjuicer didnt pull up the names and didnt see an option to have it do so..  maybe just couldnt find that title?
2007-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	probably i do not rip cd's often but iirc sound juicer does look up the tracks
2007-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	thanks..
2007-07-26T12:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	no problem
2007-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	It figures the three discs the wife wanted me to rip anre not in the db... everything working fine
2007-07-26T15:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	You can double check me...
2007-07-26T15:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Did you verify that dd command.. I very sure I had it right

2007-11-25T21:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	good morning ;)
2007-12-03T21:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	How would that be different than just burning /var/cache/apt/archives to a cd or dvd?
2007-12-03T21:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	easier for the newbie?
2007-12-03T21:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	i guess that aptoncd just do this and generates a Packages.gz to make it look like a repo
2007-12-03T21:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Cool, I bookmarked that page for later.. thanks
2007-12-03T21:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	no need to bookmark... ubotu is allways here to tell you... ;P
2007-12-03T21:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	NOt if I cant remember the trigger, I am getting old

2008-02-04T22:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	I agree...  but he seemed dead set on getting flash.... DEAD is the key word
2008-02-11T21:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	dmraid is a driver to use bios raid (fakeraid) using device mapper
2008-02-11T21:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Do you need to install from alternate to get that "dmraid" going
2008-02-11T21:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Will read up and try to ask some intelligent questions later
2008-02-25T21:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	no problem ;)
2008-02-25T21:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	you call yourself ;)
2008-02-25T21:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Yep, my op trigger didnt work
2008-03-11T18:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	that factoid needs a skull and crossbones
2008-03-11T18:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	maybe unicode provides them ;)
2008-03-11T18:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	ãƒ…
2008-03-24T19:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	bye;
2008-04-19T22:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	evening here ;) but morning to you
2008-04-19T22:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	will that work on bin/cue as well?
2008-04-19T22:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	i used the factoid for the image convresion tools part...
2008-04-19T22:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	agreed.. just curious about how you could do it without converting. it is a basic image file
2008-04-19T22:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	i think there are fuse "filesystems" plugins that do just that (acetone iso is a gui)
2008-05-21T22:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	beat me to it anyhow
2008-05-31T04:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Would you double checkmy advice to Ben
2009-01-03T22:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	abuyusuf_ that goes up in history not back in paths...
2009-01-03T22:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	I understand that
2009-01-19T02:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Are you here?
2009-01-19T02:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	yep

2009-01-19T02:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	looking... mount point / "check" file system type vfat "FAIL" 0.o!!
2009-01-19T02:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	is that from a running system???

2009-01-19T02:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Just wnated to make sure I was not crazy
2009-01-19T02:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	well that's what its there maybe he make a mistake while editing and only need to 's/vfat/ext3/' from a ivecd
2009-01-19T02:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	His question was unrelated to root
2009-01-19T02:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	yep... maybe when adding lines 10/11 he changes line 6 by mistake
2009-01-19T02:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	thanks..  but see his response above
2009-02-05T02:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	seems like the ltsp factoid can get an edit...
2009-02-05T02:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	My link or the actual factoid
2009-02-05T02:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	well the factoid should include your link imho
2009-02-05T02:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	I made a note in -ops to check it
2009-02-05T02:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	thanks
2009-02-05T17:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	Morning! \o/ ( althought 13:49 in my timezone ;P )

2009-02-25T04:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	checking...
2009-02-25T04:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	ty
2009-02-25T04:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	fails because i do not have a Desktop directory ;P my ubuntu is in spanish so i have Escritorio
2009-02-25T04:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	better to output in $HOME
2009-02-25T04:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Great.. NOted..
2009-02-25T04:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	you want the output for my system?
2009-02-25T04:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Not needed
2009-02-25T04:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	seems to work as spected...
2009-02-25T04:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erUSUL	Was just trying to make a better tool
2009-02-25T04:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	also fails if pastebinit is not installed in do_pastebin there is no sudo for the apt-get command
2009-02-25T04:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	another glitch... in do_pastebin again you hardcoded outfile instead of using $OUTFILE in the sed call
2009-02-25T04:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	more input to your script... export LC_ALL=C so the messages of the various utils do not are in native language... some of mine are in spanish
2009-02-25T04:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jack_Sparrow	hope that helps
