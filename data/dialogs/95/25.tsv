2009-05-19T22:20:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	ok, if you don't care about koffice, close add/remove and open synaptic from system tools and try to install from there.
2009-05-19T22:21:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	takes a few secs
2009-05-19T22:22:00.000Z	thuglife222	durt	 when i type in search openoffice it gives hell of open office references which one shall i install now?
2009-05-19T22:22:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	gimme a sec
2009-05-19T22:25:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	openoffice.org is the name of the meta-package that should install everything you need.
2009-05-19T22:26:00.000Z	thuglife222	durt	 i see and one thing more i need to know from you
2009-05-19T22:27:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	hopefully synaptic will let you choose to uninstall koffice. If not we can do that manually.
2009-05-19T22:28:00.000Z	thuglife222	durt	 now when i check the openoffice .org for installation it further asks me thing for mark
2009-05-19T22:28:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	mark for install, then hit apply.
2009-05-19T22:30:00.000Z	thuglife222	durt	 when i only hit mark for install it returns error

2009-05-19T22:35:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	ok, search for koffice, mark it remove and apply, retry to install oo.o
2009-05-19T22:36:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	you accidentally erase some lines from /etc/apt/sources.list?
2009-05-19T22:37:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	actually I can't remember any main repos in your sources. Wanna check that?
2009-05-19T22:38:00.000Z	durt	thuglife222	with a text editor of your choice. open '/etc/apt/sources.list'
