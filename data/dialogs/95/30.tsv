2009-01-25T06:31:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	let me know if you manage to go threw the process of createing a new connection, saving it, and connecting to your linux machine.
2009-01-25T06:31:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i have no "NEW" option
2009-01-25T06:32:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	you don't have a "New" button on the top right ?
2009-01-25T06:32:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i don't know how to fill this up either
2009-01-25T06:32:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	Do you have a user account on your linux box ?
2009-01-25T06:32:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	do you know the IP of that box ?

2009-01-25T06:34:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	these two computers are connected to the same router
2009-01-25T06:34:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	can you type "ifconfig" on a shell on your linux and find your IP ?
2009-01-25T06:36:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	still following ?
2009-01-25T06:36:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	.... i'll show you the ouput in a sec
2009-01-25T06:36:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	i'm sure you can find the IP in there yourself !:)
2009-01-25T06:36:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i see no ip
2009-01-25T06:37:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	use a USB key instead maybe ?
2009-01-25T06:37:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	yup i got it
2009-01-25T06:37:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	show me your output in a pastebin,  and i'll see.. but maybe you have no network connection working on your machine ?
2009-01-25T06:38:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	so you got the IP ?
2009-01-25T06:38:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i have it but i don't know if it's safe to send it to you
2009-01-25T06:38:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	ok
2009-01-25T06:38:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	DOn't send it, i want you to know it! :)
2009-01-25T06:39:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	and now in windows... In WinSCP, in the Host name: you type your IP
2009-01-25T06:39:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	Username: and Password: i think you know what those are too!

2009-01-25T06:44:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	if you type (in linux) :  ps -A | grep sshd           do you get anything listed ?
2009-01-25T06:45:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	and, can you technically remote access your linux box ? (Did you install the OpenSSH server)?
2009-01-25T06:45:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	no output for ps -A | grep sshd
2009-01-25T06:46:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	if i knew i would have known

2009-01-25T06:47:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	once you get that sshd thing installed.... you'll be able to remote-access your linux box with a windows client like Putty
2009-01-25T06:49:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i have a couple of similar results.... I have a 320 gig hard drive, should i just install all of it?
2009-01-25T06:49:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	ya, the synaptic manager should help you
2009-01-25T06:49:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	ok

2009-01-25T06:49:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i don't know which one to install
2009-01-25T06:50:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	somebody that knows needs to tell you which one exactly :)

2009-01-25T06:53:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	it might be fetching stuff from the web..
2009-01-25T06:55:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	i just checked openssh-server, but it seems to be doing something
2009-01-25T06:55:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	it should tell you what the dependencies are, I think.
2009-01-25T06:56:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	great :(

2009-01-25T06:58:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	or just try WinSCP again :)
2009-01-25T06:58:00.000Z	johnnnny	BlackBatMan	i should actually ask you to do : ps -A | grep sshd        before, to not waste time.

2009-01-25T06:59:00.000Z	BlackBatMan	johnnnny	private key file ?
