2010-02-21T14:23:00.000Z	newbie		so Zorin has a windows interface
2010-02-21T14:24:00.000Z	newbie		i'm on the distrowatch.com now
2010-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 none are a 'copy' of windows. some are more windows like then others
2010-02-21T14:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 never heard of it... thers dozens if not hundereds of disrtos out you could try
2010-02-21T14:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 it all depends on your neeeds and system specs
2010-02-21T14:13:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	its the 1st in OS's list in linux.com download site
2010-02-21T14:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 means very little to me. :)
2010-02-21T14:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 with what?
2010-02-21T14:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 then go get ubuntu and   have fun
2010-02-21T14:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 ubuntu BASED is not ubuntu
2010-02-21T14:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 they took ubuntu and heavly modified it
2010-02-21T14:17:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 may i have a pvt with you plz?
2010-02-21T14:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 about what? I dont use zorin or plan on using it.. I use ubuntu. for many reasons
2010-02-21T14:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 depends on your needs and system specs.
2010-02-21T14:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 we dont know what either are..unless you tell us
2010-02-21T14:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 they all have a interace.. some are more like windows then others.. some are radically diffrent
2010-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	yes I know each Os has its interface. But i want to work on linux not a copy of windows
2010-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 go try them out and see.. Most ubuntu based ones use gnome with some tweaks
2010-02-21T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 if you have a graphical interface you will be using a 'window manager'   not 'windows manager'
2010-02-21T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 thats a gernic term for a graphical user interface. a 'windowmanager' is a spcific program that manages the progrms windows you are seeing .
2010-02-21T14:27:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	sorry i did not notice the different
2010-02-21T14:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 windows does not mean 'ms windows' :) in all cases
2010-02-21T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 you are using a window manager if you are using X and a GUI on Linux most likely. theres dozens of 'window maangers' you could be using.
2010-02-21T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 a 'desktop' is a window manager + a set of apps to give a full featured work 'area' for you to do things in
2010-02-21T14:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 summary of most winow managers for X ==>>>  http://xwinman.org/
2010-02-21T14:33:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 i will have a look there
2010-08-15T08:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 state the actual problem to the channel.
2010-08-15T08:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 with video issues. always tgell the channel the exact chipset.
2012-05-23T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 what os is  onthe other pcs? Samba should work in most cases
2012-05-23T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 if you  just  want to  do  some quick  transfers, you  can use other  tools also
2012-05-23T09:42:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 nine_  Bsims  the other os is also *buntu  i though samba is for windows file sharing?
2012-05-23T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	  you  may  want to check out 'sshfs'  and learn how  to  use scp and ssh. VERY worthwile  info  toknow
2012-05-23T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 with  scp  you can easially  copy  files tothe other pc
2012-05-23T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 id use scpthen, install ssh  on both machines.  then you  can  scp from one box to  the  other
2012-05-23T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 sshfs can  mount a remote box locally.as a simple way tohave a 'share' or you  canuse samba,or nfs,
2012-05-23T09:49:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 ryanturner  thanks !
2012-05-23T21:39:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 ill reboot
2012-05-23T21:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 what sort of 'service' are you refering to?
2012-05-23T21:13:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 i have installed samba on both computers. and i want to share files from one to another. i just go to samba shares and can view the folders but cant acces them
2012-05-23T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 you gave the user a samba password with the 'sudo smbpasswd -a username' command on the machines?
2012-05-23T21:16:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 no... on which should i give it. client or server. and by the way i am unable to view the contents now. and nautilus says unable to mount share folder.
2012-05-23T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 the machine that the user is connecting to needs to be setup for a samba password for them to login with.
2012-05-23T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 i set up both machines the same way. since i could be going either direction
2012-05-23T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 if you use the on the fly share creation fature of nautilus, you can make guest accessable shares.. or set a password.
2012-05-23T21:19:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 ok so i should do sudo smb passwd -a :the username of?" ?
2012-05-23T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	  the server has an identical user as the connecting machine?  whatever user name you want to use on the server and will be entering.
2012-05-23T21:20:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 i did the same thing. enable guest accesable shares by nautilus but now it doesnt even shows the contents. at first it was but not accepting password. or i should say letting me in
2012-05-23T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 i rarely use the nautilus feature. i normally edit the smb.conf file and enable home shares, and then give the users samba passwords.  so all their home files are allready shared.
2012-05-23T21:20:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 ya.. both users of both machins have the same name. how did you know?
2012-05-23T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 so give both users the same samba password.
2012-05-23T21:23:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 username is the username of both machins . that is bob in my case
2012-05-23T21:24:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 right ?
2012-05-23T21:26:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 it says unable to mount windows share
2012-05-23T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 did it ask for a username/pass?   you could enter the full path to the share in nautilus's  address bar..   ctrl-L then -> smb://server.ip.number/sharename
2012-05-23T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 and to make things easier.. dont ever use spaces in share names. ;)
2012-05-23T21:30:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 it did asked and i gave one. and it keeps asking again and again and not let me in
2012-05-23T21:32:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 what could be wrong. mounting problem or permision problem
2012-05-23T21:33:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 and i am giving computer name instead of ip name
2012-05-23T21:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 try the ip # ?
2012-05-23T21:34:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 how do i know my ip
2012-05-23T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 look on teh server and its ifconfig command
2012-05-23T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 perhaps the smbtree or findsmb command may show it also
2012-05-23T21:37:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 did that but same problem. do i need to reboot. what could be the problem. i can see the shares but cant get in
2012-05-23T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 no idea. I dont fight wiath samba much any more.  for a linux to linux box id just use sshfs
2012-05-23T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 you could try restarting the samba service on both machines i guess.
2012-05-23T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 also i tend to edit the smb.conf and enable the homes share feature.  i rarely use the user-controlled-shares
2012-05-23T21:40:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 hmm. i was trying to share a partition that is to be mounted each time i reboot. (it is mounted by the way.)
2012-05-23T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 you will want to have that partion mounted via fstab most likely. Otehrwise it wont be shared untill the user logs in.. and what FS is the partition?
2012-05-23T21:42:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	the partition that is to be shared is ntfs (windows files system)
2012-05-23T21:45:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 how do i edit fstab. what do i need to chang
2012-05-23T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 shareing a ntfs/vfat may require some extra options in the fstab file also. been a while since i shared a ntfs/vfat
2012-05-23T21:47:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 hmm. so difficult thing.
2012-05-23T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 rather trivial actually...
2012-05-23T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 but it depends on what thing you are talking about.
2012-05-23T21:48:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	^
2012-05-23T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 samba has 100000's of documents out there about it.. whole books on its ussage
2012-05-23T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 samba can work for Huge businesses with 1000's of people and shares...
2012-05-23T21:49:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 i dont want to spend 1 month just tring to share a partition
2012-05-23T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 if you want simple access to anotehr ubuntu box.. we suggested sshfs, and/or nfs
2012-05-23T21:49:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 ya i know its very powerfull but ...
2012-05-23T21:50:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 its already an ntfs
2012-05-23T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 and its mounted ON the FLy..  so thats 2 very big complications to it.
2012-05-23T21:50:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	yes. its never permemntly mounted at boot. i click it and dolphine/nautilus mounts it auto
2012-05-23T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 so i would make fstab mount it at boot.  then edit the smb.conf to make it shared by the system. not a user.
2012-05-23T21:51:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 hm. i see theres not fstab command in terminal. strange
2012-05-23T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 not at all. there is no fstab command...
2012-05-23T21:52:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	oh ok
2012-05-23T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 the ntfs-config tool Might setup a proper fstab entry for that filesystem. i do it by hand normally
2012-05-23T21:54:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 how do you know the uids by the way
2012-05-23T22:03:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 bazhang  no luck with ntfs-config    . iam stuck with unable to share ntfs partition
2012-05-23T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 you could practice by shareing some Other directory so you know samba is working.  then work on shareing the ntfs. You can edit the fstab by hand,
2012-05-23T22:10:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 ok. now the home folder is not even adding . previously i added atleast ntfs .(despite i couldnt login) any ways. let me see what i can do. see you in some time.
2012-05-23T22:18:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 i can acces /home/bob/documents but when i try to share /home/bob it doenst.
2012-05-23T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	newbie	 i normally edit the smb.conf file to have it make the  special 'home' share. each users home is then shared under the smb://servername/username  share
2012-05-23T22:20:00.000Z	newbie	Dr_Willis	 thanks. but i really have to struge to share the ntfs partition. iam a newbie
