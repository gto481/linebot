2005-07-14T16:15:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		lol you guys know where I can get lvc?? it doesn't show up on synaptic
2005-07-14T16:15:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		*sigh*
2005-07-14T16:16:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		<---- no one hears....
2005-07-14T16:17:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	VLC
2005-07-14T16:17:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	stands for vido lan client, i think
2005-07-14T16:17:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	work well?
2005-07-14T16:17:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yep. one of the best
2005-07-14T16:18:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	personally i don't like the interface, but it plays pretty much anything
2005-07-14T16:18:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	i use xine when i can. then vlc or mplayer when it doesn't play something
2005-07-14T16:18:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yes
2005-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	it would be under Multimedia right
2005-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	i find xine easy to use, and it plays pretty much everything once you've installed the codecs from the repo
2005-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	repo?
2005-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeah. i don't use the categories though. it's easier to just search for what you're looking for, or apt-get it
2005-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	repo = short for repository
2005-07-14T16:21:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	do you know if it would be gxine?
2005-07-14T16:21:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	that's the gnome xine interface
2005-07-14T16:21:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	i prefer the regular xine
2005-07-14T16:21:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	xine-ui then?
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeah
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	that would be xine User Interface
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	k, thx =) i tried Totem for some Dvds... and I dunno if it was my computer or totem, but they just wouldn't play so I'm gonna try xine first before going any further
2005-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	i find xine is great with DVDs & CDs. it has buttons for that. just click & it plays
2005-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	does the menus too, IIRC
2005-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	do you know how to like rip straight to your drive?
2005-07-14T16:24:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	so you can watch anytime ...
2005-07-14T16:24:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeh, there's a bunch of apps for that. try searching
2005-07-14T16:24:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	kk =)
2005-07-14T16:24:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	handy sites: google.com/linux & www.sf.net
2005-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	it's a library that lets your apps decode encrytped dvds
2005-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	o... i'm guessing that xine should do that as well?
2005-07-14T16:26:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeah
2005-07-14T16:26:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	actually, i dunno if it uses that, cause i have it too
2005-07-14T16:26:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	might do it on it's own though
2005-07-14T16:26:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	i just got xine installed... so going to try it but how do you do repository stuff?
2005-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	uh, what 'repository stuff'?
2005-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	well.... you said you can download codecs from the repository?
2005-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeh, do a search in description & name for codec
2005-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	:p
2005-07-14T16:28:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	lol thx =) i think I'm done bothering you for a bit ;-)
2005-07-14T16:28:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	and see the link nalioths_dog posted for adding repositories
2005-07-14T16:28:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	atleast for now ;-)
2005-07-14T16:32:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	real quick question, how do i turn it so that Totem doens't start my DVDs up automatically?
2005-07-14T16:33:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	hrm. that's probably a gnome setting. poke around in the menus
2005-07-14T16:33:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	can't help much as i'm not on either gnome or ubuntu ATM
2005-07-14T16:33:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	o, =) kk
2005-07-14T16:42:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	might poke around in totem's settings actually...
2005-07-14T16:42:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	yea... still looking and I'm not finding anything just yet...
2005-07-14T05:06:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	if a folder or file is 'locked' then you don't have permissions because you either aren't the owner, or aren't root
2005-07-14T05:07:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	just a note in case you don't know... never log in as root, except in a terminal, and only if necessary. use sudo instead
2005-07-14T05:07:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	yea! see... how do you use sudo to open up the folder and create a codec folder inside?
2005-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	if you want to create a sub folder, then in a terminal, put 'sudo mkdir foldername'
2005-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	use the full path if you can't cd into that dir first
2005-07-14T05:09:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	another handy tip if you don't know: use tab completion
2005-07-14T05:10:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	sudo = Super User DO. ie, do as super user (root)
2005-07-14T05:10:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	you can use it to run just about any command as root
2005-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	i just haven't learned all the mkdir, and such commands yet...
2005-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeh.. they're handy to know. use 'man' frequently
2005-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	will do =) how do you extract files into the folder once you are ready though? with like the sudo command?
2005-07-14T05:12:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	you can either change the permissions on the folder, or do it as root. as i said, you can run most commands as root with sudo: 'sudo command arguments'
2005-07-14T05:13:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	see 'man sudo'
2005-07-14T05:15:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	i just gotta find out what the sudo command is to extra files though
2005-07-14T05:15:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	er, no. you need the command to extract files or whatever it is you're trying to do. then just put sudo in front of it to do it as root
2005-07-14T05:16:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	oooo lol
2005-07-14T05:16:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	k then.. i need to know the extract command for terminal =D
2005-07-14T05:16:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	could be tar, unzip, unrar, etc
2005-07-14T05:17:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	prolly tar. 'man tar'
2005-07-14T05:17:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	yea, it just says .tar.bz2
2005-07-14T05:17:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	is this your idea of ripping...?
2005-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	you ought to be able to extract it in nautilus or something
2005-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	you don't have to do everything in the terminal
2005-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	oh yeah... no permissions
2005-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	yea... but when i try to extract it in whatever progam Ubuntu uses... it says I don't have permission and I don't know how to get past it
2005-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	did you check what's _in_ the file first?
2005-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	are you sure it has the codecs, and only the codecs in them? might also have source, etc. IOW, things you don't need in /usr/lib
2005-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	yea... and it has a readme that says to put all the files into /usr/local/lib/codecs
2005-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	k
2005-07-14T05:29:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	that's a confusing error, lol
2005-07-14T05:30:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	ahem. shouldn't paste in here
2005-07-14T05:30:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	there's rafb.net/paste and stuff liek that for pasting
2005-07-14T05:32:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	did you use tab completion?
2005-07-14T05:32:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	type the first few chars, and hit tab, and it completes it for you
2005-07-14T05:32:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	yea... but now it says - r is an invalid option... is that right?? sudo mkir -r?
2005-07-14T05:33:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	man mkdir :p
2005-07-14T05:34:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	as you can see in 'man mkdir' there's no -r option
2005-07-14T05:37:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	that's why tab completion helps. use it. frequently
2005-07-14T05:37:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	did the second time around and that's the only reason i figured it out ;-)
2005-07-14T05:40:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	yeh. copy & paste that
2005-07-14T05:40:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	* is a wildcard
2005-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	usually that means success. otherwise it gives an error/info message
2005-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	kk
2005-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	=)
2005-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	Danar	MidNightRaVeN	64 if you can
2005-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	Danar	kk...
