2009-08-29T16:57:00.000Z	_nano_		Hi all, is there a way to enable network at boot time in ubuntu jaunty? Right now networkmanager enables network only after a person logs in
2009-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	are you using wired or wireless internet?
2009-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	wired ethernet
2009-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	static IP, or are you getting it via dhcp?
2009-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	static ip
2009-08-29T17:00:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	I can configure static ip in networkmanager, but it only gets enabled once you login. I want the network on when the machine turns on, kind of like a server
2009-08-29T17:00:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	can I help you in a sec? it's rather straightforward to do, I've done it many times.
2009-08-29T17:01:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	really appreciate it , i'll wait
2009-08-29T17:04:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	if you log in, and log back out, does the network stay connected? do you have another computer to talk on, while we set up the connection?
2009-08-29T17:04:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	let me set that up ..just a sec
2009-08-29T17:05:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yup I'm ready
2009-08-29T17:06:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	good. Turn the computer off, reboot it. Don't log in at GDM (or whatever you use).
2009-08-29T17:06:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	alright
2009-08-29T17:06:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	hit ctrl-alt-F2. log in with your regular username and password.
2009-08-29T17:07:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	alright will let you know once I've done so
2009-08-29T17:08:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	logged in (in command line)
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	great. To start,  please type lspci.
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yeah a list of devices
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	including the Ethernet controller
2009-08-29T17:10:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	OK. Try pinging ubuntu.com with 'ping ubuntu.com'
2009-08-29T17:10:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	how ???
2009-08-29T17:10:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	I don't know, I guess network manager configured it for you. Did you reboot after you logged out?
2009-08-29T17:11:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yeah !
2009-08-29T17:11:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	cool. You might not have static IP, though.
2009-08-29T17:11:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	type 'ifconfig'. See if your IP is the one you want.
2009-08-29T17:11:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yeah you're right, it's automatically assigned IP
2009-08-29T17:12:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	so which file should I set it at ?
2009-08-29T17:12:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	do dhclient -r interfacename
2009-08-29T17:13:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	it's saying something like Listening on ... Sending On
2009-08-29T17:13:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	is the program closed, though? is your prompt there?
2009-08-29T17:13:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yeah the prompt is there
2009-08-29T17:14:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	good. Type ifconfig eth0 down
2009-08-29T17:14:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	done, no confirmation message, came back to the prompt
2009-08-29T17:16:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	do 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.x.x netmask 255.255.255.0 up'
2009-08-29T17:17:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	did. can't ping
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	what does ifconfig say?
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	is there a way to put gateway in that command?
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	well the ip  and netmask is showing
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	but cant ping
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	 can you ping another machine on the network?
2009-08-29T17:19:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yes I am able to ping other machines in my network, just not outside hosts
2009-08-29T17:19:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	that's great, we haven't configured DNS servers yet.
2009-08-29T17:20:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	I don't know about DNS servers, it's connected from a router, in networkmanager it never asked me and it worked :(
2009-08-29T17:20:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	don't worry about it, it's easy :)
2009-08-29T17:20:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	alright
2009-08-29T17:20:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	do 'nano /etc/resolv.conf'
2009-08-29T17:20:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	lol, yeah i see two nameserver entries
2009-08-29T17:21:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	what exactly does it say?
2009-08-29T17:22:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	above message
2009-08-29T17:22:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	OK. when you uninstall NM, it;'ll delete that file, so you might want to make a backup if you don't want to manually edit it again.
2009-08-29T17:22:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	for the gateway, you need to do 'route add default gw 192.168.x.x'
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	is there a file where i can put all this ?
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	then you should be able to ping the outside world.
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	we'll save these commands so they're executed at bootup later.
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	ok i've backed it up
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	great.
2009-08-29T17:24:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	do the 'route add' thing. Can you ping ubuntu.com? :)
2009-08-29T17:24:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yes it's working :)
2009-08-29T17:24:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	i meant by routed add thingy
2009-08-29T17:24:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	great. Almost there.
2009-08-29T17:25:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	now, it's time to configure everything to be run at startup.
2009-08-29T17:25:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	i'm all set
2009-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	for the next step i mean
2009-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	firstly, you can delete network-manager and network-manager-gnome
2009-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	aptitude remove?
2009-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	ok
2009-08-29T17:26:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	I think ...-gnome will be uninstalled as well, it relies on the first one.
2009-08-29T17:27:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yeah 2 packages removed
2009-08-29T17:27:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	OK.  do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-08-29T17:28:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	it's saying ignoring interface eth0=eth0
2009-08-29T17:28:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	now what?
2009-08-29T17:28:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	then, restore the backup of /etc/resolv.conf, if its been deleted.
2009-08-29T17:29:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	restored
2009-08-29T17:29:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	(the network went down when I did the networking restart thing)
2009-08-29T17:29:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	do 'sudo nano /etc/rc.local'
2009-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	did, nothing's there except exit 0
2009-08-29T17:30:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	I mean apart from comments
2009-08-29T17:32:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	before exit 0, add 'ifconfig eth0 down /n dhclient -r eth0 /n ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.x.x netmask 255.255.255.0 up /n route add default gw 192.168.x.x'
2009-08-29T17:32:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	ok
2009-08-29T17:33:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	ok done
2009-08-29T17:34:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	try doing 'sudo /etc/rc.local'. Is your internet working now?
2009-08-29T17:34:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yes!! its working :)
2009-08-29T17:34:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	does that mean it's enabled at boot ?
2009-08-29T17:34:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	great :) try rebooting
2009-08-29T17:34:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	ok
2009-08-29T17:37:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	yes its working at boot :) , now the nameservers .. someway to get it configured automatically ?
2009-08-29T17:37:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	the nameservers (DNS) aren't working?
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	they are ..just that if network manager was able to automatically detect it
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	anyways for now it's working so thanks a lot :)
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	really appreciate your time and help :)
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	you could change /etc/resolv.conf to the name of your routers IP
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	you're welcome :)
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	ok
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	_nano_	Peddy	thanks again
2009-08-29T17:38:00.000Z	Peddy	_nano_	NM was only detecting the router's IP.
