2011-04-08T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	what are you talking about, you shouldn't be root
2011-04-08T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	then what is the root terminal
2011-04-08T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	what are you talkiong about
2011-04-08T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	as your current user, issue the command I gave you
2011-04-08T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	use sudo
2011-04-08T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	half the problems will be you trying to get around things like sudo, use the correct tools,
2011-04-08T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	that menu item should not exist
2011-04-08T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	there is no ubuntu install that creates a root terminal menu item
2011-04-08T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	then you are possibly not using an offiical ubuntu release
2011-04-08T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	why are you using an audio studio distro for web development ?
2011-04-08T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	"sudo apt-get install mysql-server"
2011-04-08T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	clearly not just addons if there is an item called "root shell"
2011-04-08T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	ok, "sudo service mysql start"
2011-04-08T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	mysql -u root -p
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	did you do the command I told you to do
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	what happened
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	are you at a mysql command prompt ?
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	you are not using oracle
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	what ?
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	are you at the mysql command prompt
2011-04-08T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	so if you do "show databases
2011-04-08T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	so if you do "show databases;"
2011-04-08T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	I thought you said you knew mysql ?
2011-04-08T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	showing a database is basic
2011-04-08T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	did it work
2011-04-08T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	ok, so you now have a working mysql database based on the ubuntu packages
2011-04-08T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	that's a different issue,
2011-04-08T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	I advise you to join #mysql and learn the basics of managing a basic database
2011-04-08T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	I'm not interested in doing that, sorry
2011-04-08T15:28:00.000Z	opticx	ikonia	I have phpmyadmin running now, thank you for all your valuable time and knowledge
2011-04-08T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	opticx	I have two
