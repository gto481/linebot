2006-05-18T10:26:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	if your bios clock is set to local time, your suffering will increase; it should be set to GMT/UTC and then your TZ should be configured correctly

2006-05-18T10:30:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	you can use ntp to set the system clock
2006-05-18T10:31:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	i what is TZ
2006-05-18T10:31:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	sorry, timezone

2006-05-18T10:33:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	do you have ntpdate installed? if not, do 'sudo apt-get install ntpdate'
2006-05-18T10:35:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	ntpdate is already the newest version.
2006-05-18T10:36:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	so do sudo /etc/init.d/ntpdate restart

2006-05-18T10:39:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	ok; no do 'sudo hwclock --systohc --utc'

2006-05-18T10:41:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	done
2006-05-18T10:41:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	that sets your bios clock to UTC/GMT, based on the system (kernel) time
2006-05-18T10:42:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	ok stay in channel let me boot my computer and check my bios time okay
2006-05-18T10:42:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I hear and obey
2006-05-18T10:42:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	in clock preference what to check
2006-05-18T10:42:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	clock preference?
2006-05-18T10:42:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	yes
2006-05-18T10:43:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	i use clock type 12 hours
2006-05-18T10:43:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I have no idea what you're talking about
2006-05-18T10:43:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	makes no difference
2006-05-18T10:43:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	show date
2006-05-18T10:43:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	but USE UTC un checked
2006-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	check use UTC
2006-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	what is USE UTC
2006-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	ok done
2006-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I assume that's for the bios clock
2006-05-18T10:44:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I don't know what you are doing
2006-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	oh my god, as i checked it my ubuntu time get changed
2006-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	what it dose
2006-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	you dual boot windows?
2006-05-18T10:45:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	again showing wrong time
2006-05-18T10:46:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	but both windows r in different HDD
2006-05-18T10:46:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I hadn't realised that windows was still as broken as win95
2006-05-18T10:46:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	makes no difference, windows will fsck it up
2006-05-18T10:47:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	So, uncheck UTC
2006-05-18T10:47:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	you must set your TZ to GMT/UTC and have the bios clock in local time - kill bill, that's what I say ;)
2006-05-18T10:47:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	so, because of windows, you have to have incorrect TZ in linux
2006-05-18T10:52:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	ok i rebooted
2006-05-18T10:53:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	BIOS time is incorrect
2006-05-18T10:53:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	don't listen to me, I had misjudged, yet again, the evil that comes from Redmond
2006-05-18T10:53:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	but this time ubuntu time is correct
2006-05-18T10:53:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	what???
2006-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	the Land of Redmond, where the shadows lie
2006-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	ok u mean u wont help me
2006-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	ok as u wish
2006-05-18T10:55:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	ffs, stop blathering; because you have a damn fool legacy os installed, which is broken, your bios clock must be set to local time, linux must not use UTC, and your time zone in linux must be set to UTC/GMT
2006-05-18T10:57:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	if you have your correct time zone set in linux, with the bios clock set to local time, your time zone offset from UTC will be applied twice, which will be incorrect
2006-05-18T10:58:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	so what is the conclusion
2006-05-18T10:58:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I've told you twice already
2006-05-18T10:58:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	BIOS WILL SHOW ME INCORRECT
2006-05-18T10:59:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	1) set your bios clock to local time; 2) set your TZ to UTC/GMT
2006-05-18T10:59:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	2) is in linux
2006-05-18T10:59:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	or don't dual boot with windows, so you don't have to break your linux system
2006-05-18T11:00:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	i am really confused
2006-05-18T11:00:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I am wrong, apparently
2006-05-23T12:54:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	sudo apt-get update
2006-05-23T13:06:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	thanx after update it works no ERROR WINDOW
2006-05-23T13:07:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	cool
2006-05-23T13:10:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	hav u ever used LaunchPad,
2006-05-23T13:11:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	indeed not
2006-05-23T13:11:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	unless grun counts ;)
2006-05-23T13:11:00.000Z	ferronica	amphi	what???
2006-05-23T13:12:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	I don't know what launchpad is

2006-05-23T15:06:00.000Z	amphi	ferronica	do sudo apt-get update
