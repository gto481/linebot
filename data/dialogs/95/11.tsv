2011-09-30T10:01:00.000Z	RP64_		Hello mr action are you there sir
2011-09-30T10:01:00.000Z	RP64_		mr action I have a peculiar development if it interests you
2011-09-30T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	wassup?  please use TAB to complete nicks too, it highlights my name
2011-09-30T10:02:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	hey cool so basically what happened was i was reading the link you sent me
2011-09-30T10:03:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 And so, I don't have that in it, I mean there's probably a way to add it, however do you think the option of nomodeset would do the same thing?
2011-09-30T10:03:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 because that's one of the preset ones
2011-09-30T10:03:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 I'm not an exceptionally lazy person I am just sleep deprived at the moment
2011-09-30T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	you only need to blacklist the nouveau driver, you will then use the nv driver and get a display, you are getting waay too hung up on nomodeset. I ONLY ave that link as it shows how to apply boot options
2011-09-30T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	the fact it says nomodeset is of no value to you, the METHOD is the ony thing you want from the guide
2011-09-30T10:05:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 Oh, I didn't really understand the whole point of your instructions then, I thought nouveau was the name of a kernel option
2011-09-30T10:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	no, nouveau is an open source nvidia driver, the bootoption:  nouveau.blacklist=1    tells the kernel to never load it
2011-09-30T10:06:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	Oh, well , I am really not good at this, I have no clue how to add "nouveau.blacklist=1" as a bootoption, because in that forum conversation they were only talking about how to add nomodeset kernel option
2011-09-30T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	ok we can do it a different way, boot the OS and hold SHIFT. When the Grub menu shows. Press 'e'   and you will see the boot options. Delete the word:  quiet splash   and in the sAME place, write: nouveau.blacklist=1    then press ENTER to continue the boot
2011-09-30T10:09:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 OH OK perfect, and after that I'll install updates, which will include update to Nvidia drivers AKA fix the problem of black screen, then I'll reboot doing the same thing and replace nouveau.blacklist=1 with quiet splash again?
2011-09-30T10:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	itsliterally THAT easy
2011-09-30T10:09:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 wow thats awesome but is my second step correct too ?
2011-09-30T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	you may not need to blacklist with the updated driver. But yes you may need to re-add the option
2011-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 in other words may need to remove the nouveau.blacklist=1 afterwards, and may need to re add that old option too, by the way if I DO need to do those things how will it let me know?
2011-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	you won't need to remove it, its only a one shot addition as its not in any confi files, you only added it for this boot
2011-09-30T10:24:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 Hey i was AFK im back
2011-09-30T10:25:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 thanks for ur help man i have no idea how you memorized all of that
2011-09-30T10:25:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 when you don't even need to do it yourself i mean did you memorize all procedures for problems in ubuntu?
2011-09-30T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	experience is the way I remember stuff
2011-09-30T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	and howto guides I give folks
2011-09-30T10:34:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 Hey, so that all covered step #1 perfectly but please excuse my severly tired self , I don't remember step #2, it is precisely to use synaptic to update Nvidia drivers, and then reboot after that installation of new drivers? And afterwards, the boot settings will reset to normal because nothing was added to "confi" files, right?
2011-09-30T10:43:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 Hey im sorry to bother you because I know you're sort of carrying everyone on your back atm, but I just had a last question to clarify... I mean is the last step precisely to use synaptic to update Nvidia drivers, and tehn reboot after that installation of new drivers? And afterwards, the boot settings will reset to normal because nothing was added to "confi" files, right?
2011-09-30T10:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	get fully updated, then reboot. Have you done that?
2011-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 hey no, I just wanted to clarify that my final steps were to do that um and then yeah im just about to do that
2011-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 however fritsch has a point of something to do with nvidia binary install that INSTEAD fritsch didnt you say that?
2011-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	get updates and reboot, see how it goes from there
2011-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	I recommend getting updates first, then install the driver
2011-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 OK thanks dudes ill try it
2011-09-30T12:04:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 hey bro back
2011-09-30T12:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	word
2011-09-30T12:07:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	it didn't work to my surprise, still black screen! ugh , then I tried the method of going in to the shell with networking, and doing sudo apt-get install nvidia-current and it couldnt connect because of it being wireless ,
2011-09-30T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	you in the liveCD?
2011-09-30T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	ok run:  sudo fdisk -l    what is the disk called, sda is common
2011-09-30T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	which partition name has ubuntu on it, the boot partition?
2011-09-30T12:08:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 OK it's sda5
2011-09-30T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	ok cool
2011-09-30T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	run in the live environment:   sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/
2011-09-30T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	good, let me know if you get any errors
2011-09-30T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	sudo mount ‐‐bind /dev /mnt/dev
2011-09-30T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	any error?
2011-09-30T12:11:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 hmm doesn't seem to be any errors, it's just listing sort of explanations about mounting
2011-09-30T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	are you copying the text and pasting to the terminal?
2011-09-30T12:11:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 yep
2011-09-30T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	sudo mount ‐‐bind /dev /mnt/dev
2011-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	we want zero output
2011-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	sudo mount ‐‐bind /proc /mnt/proc
2011-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	try that
2011-09-30T12:14:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 that doesn't seem to do anything different
2011-09-30T12:14:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 the things that got listed before were so incredibly long and now when i tried that new one proc mntproc , nothing happened as far as I can see no new text came up
2011-09-30T12:15:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 but either way, no errors are reported I don't see the word error anywhere
2011-09-30T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	ok if you run:  ls /mnt    do you see : bin  boot  cdrom  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  lib  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  selinux  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz
2011-09-30T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	if there is any output from the commands I gave, it didn't work
2011-09-30T12:16:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 mine differs a little bit, but very similar
2011-09-30T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	do you see sys proc and dev ?
2011-09-30T12:17:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 if i type in ls /mnt, it says : bin boot cdrom dev etc home initrd.img lib lib32 lib64 lost+found media mnt opt proc root sbin selinux srv sys tmp usr var vmlinuz
2011-09-30T12:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	looks good
2011-09-30T12:18:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 so is there some new plan / idea? lol
2011-09-30T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
2011-09-30T12:19:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 doesn't do anything
2011-09-30T12:20:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 is that bad if it doesn't do anything
2011-09-30T12:21:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 u still there
2011-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 i gotta sleep pretty soon cus im dying from lack of it
2011-09-30T12:24:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 hey you still around bud
2011-09-30T12:51:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 HEY YOUre back man!
2011-09-30T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	get a wired link dude, so much easier
2011-09-30T12:51:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 I can't , it's my landlord's connection
2011-09-30T12:52:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	Hey, I can't there's no outlets in my house
2011-09-30T12:52:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 so basically, I have only this choice of wireless, is it still possible? can you do it through LiveCD onto the ubuntu installation?
2011-09-30T12:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	you can install the nvidia driver in the live cd, mount the internal partition and copy the deb files to the internal partition, then boot to root recovery mode and install the debs there
2011-09-30T12:53:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 that'd work? Uhh how do I do that can it be done in like 20 minutes
2011-09-30T12:54:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	do you think we just got the specifications for chroot wrong somehow?
2011-09-30T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	use the additional drivers app and install the driver in the live environment.
2011-09-30T12:54:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 on the liveCD rihgt now ?
2011-09-30T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	yes
2011-09-30T12:54:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 oh if it's very weird do you think my installation is like defective or something lol
2011-09-30T12:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	doubt it but copying the files should be ok
2011-09-30T12:56:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 does that change anything?
2011-09-30T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	we just want the files, they will be in /var/cache/apt/archives    you can then run:  gksudo nautilus    select the internal partition from the left panel to mount it and copy the files over
2011-09-30T12:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	only in the live CD, copying the files is what we need :)
2011-09-30T12:57:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 how long will it take cus im almost dead from no sleep, will it take like 20 minutes or so?
2011-09-30T12:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	about that long, yes
2011-09-30T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	i'd get some sleep, it'll be easier
2011-09-30T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	GMT here
2011-09-30T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	10am
2011-09-30T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	nope, people do live outside USA
2011-09-30T13:00:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 yeah including me lol
2011-09-30T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RP64_	as theadmin says
2011-09-30T13:00:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	im in canada
2011-09-30T13:01:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	 but anyways so i guess you're in middle of europe OK so its 8 hours difference
2011-09-30T13:01:00.000Z	RP64_	ActionParsnip	OK so ill probably be on in like 10 hours would you be there then or how could I reach youbecause you already worked with it this far right? lol
