2009-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	it should bring you to a text-only terminal, where you can fix things.
2009-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	When i come to the weerd looking login screen the keyboard doesn't respond
2009-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Can i come back in 5 minutes?

2009-08-29T17:05:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	you can't type, correct? At the grub prompt when you reboot, please hit escape, then highlight the first line, and press E. remove the 'quiet' and 'splash' lines. Don't worry about messing anything up, these changes are not saved.
2009-08-29T17:07:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	how's it going?
2009-08-29T17:08:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	can you see them?
2009-08-29T17:08:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	I just have 1 of them, the "quiet"
2009-08-29T17:08:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	remove that, then press b to boot.
2009-08-29T17:08:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	ok
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Booting
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	do ctrl-alt-F1 again. Do you see scrolling text?
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Nothing has changed...
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Oh -.-
2009-08-29T17:09:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	W8
2009-08-29T17:11:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	i saw a scrolling text, then the failed login-screen comes up :/
2009-08-29T17:11:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	reboot, and select 'recovery mode' from the GRUB menu, please.
2009-08-29T17:12:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	 Ok
2009-08-29T17:12:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	choose 'drop to root shell'
2009-08-29T17:13:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	done
2009-08-29T17:15:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	can you type 'sudo apt-get install envyng-core' please
2009-08-29T17:15:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Yes, one sec
2009-08-29T17:15:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	you don't actually need the sudo, but whatever :-P
2009-08-29T17:16:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	I alreaday had that package
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	do 'envyng -t' please.
2009-08-29T17:18:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Now im in EnvyNG Menu :)
2009-08-29T17:19:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	you probably want to choose option 3
2009-08-29T17:19:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Install ATI drivers? :)
2009-08-29T17:19:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	 I will
2009-08-29T17:21:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	There is now only one option, and that one is already installed...
2009-08-29T17:21:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	try uninstalling it with option 4 and reinstalling it.
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Restart after unistall is done?
2009-08-29T17:23:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	yep.
2009-08-29T17:24:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Should i try to start the comp without installing the drivers?
2009-08-29T17:25:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	oh, I thought you reinstalled them. You need to install them again, then try rebooting. EnvyNG should detect which ones work with your card.
2009-08-29T17:25:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Ok, i will
2009-08-29T17:27:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	It wont install it...
2009-08-29T17:27:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	what happens?
2009-08-29T17:29:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	I click to install it and the option fore what drive i should use comes up, theres only one option. I pick that one and it "installs" and it sais Faild to fetch some things on internet...

2009-08-29T17:44:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Restart?
2009-08-29T17:44:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	good. Reboot. I don't think it's going to work, though
2009-08-29T17:46:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Didnt work :(
2009-08-29T17:47:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	ugh. Basically, the drivers from AMD don't support the version of X server Jaunty uses.
2009-08-29T17:48:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Ok...
2009-08-29T17:48:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	you could try an earlier version of Ubuntu, such as 8.10. It should work out of the box.
2009-08-29T17:49:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	without what? the problems?
2009-08-29T17:51:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Thanks for all the help :D
2009-08-29T17:51:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	oh, right! I actually don't think there's any way to do that. Installing an older version of X server would cause incompatibility with a whole bunch of programs. There was quite an uproar about this very same issue a while back.
2009-08-29T17:52:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	I'm very sorry that your experience with Ubuntu hasn't been satisfactory :/ hopefully you get it working.
2009-08-29T17:52:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	8.10 should work, and for the future, nvidia tends to play better with GNU/Linux...
2009-08-29T17:52:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	I love ubuntu, its great... But it isnt Windows...
2009-08-29T17:53:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Ubuntu has worked before... it's just that it doesnt work now
2009-08-29T17:53:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	old ATi cards won't work with 9.04 until AMD fixes it, period.
2009-08-29T17:53:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Thank You!
2009-08-29T17:53:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirox	I'm going now, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance :) have a good night. :D
2009-08-29T17:54:00.000Z	Shasirox	Peddy	Time is 15:00 here :P
